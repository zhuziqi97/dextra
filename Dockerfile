# libicu72: OfficeCLI ships as a self-contained binary with an embedded .NET
# runtime, which requires the system ICU library at startup. node:*-bookworm-slim
# bundles Node's own ICU statically and so does NOT install system libicu — without
# this, every `officecli` invocation aborts with "Couldn't find a valid ICU package
# installed on the system", breaking both skill sync and office file preview in the
# server/Docker mode. The version (72) is pinned to Debian bookworm; bump it to match
# if the base image moves to a newer Debian release (e.g. trixie ships libicu76).
