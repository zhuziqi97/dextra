 * an unrelated conversation's stream no longer re-renders them; callbacks read
 * fresh state via `useConversationRuntimeStore.getState()`.

 * cards torn mid-word whenever sub-agents stream concurrently (#494).
 *

 * card) and nothing else. Those are out-of-band for the main thread, so the
 * split they caused is an artifact, not a boundary.
 *
 * Two rules keep this from fusing across a real boundary that something
 * upstream erased:
 *
 * 1. Computed over `liveMessage.content`, NOT the array Phase 2 walks: by then
 *    `collapseLiveCollabBlocks` has dropped a completed codex `closeAgent`,
 *    and prose on either side of it must stay two blocks. That collapse never
 *    drops or rewrites prose and preserves order, so prose blocks are
 *    identity-stable across it.
 * 2. A sub-agent block must ACTUALLY sit between the two. The split predicate
 *    (`applyStreamingAction` / `append_text_delta`) merges same-kind same-
 *    attribution deltas, so it can never leave two same-kind main-thread prose
 *    blocks directly adjacent — that shape means something was removed. The
 *    `PLAN_UPDATE` reducer is one such remover: it keeps at most one plan block
 *    and relocates it to the end, so `thinking → plan(v1) → thinking → plan(v2)`
 *    reaches us as two adjacent thinking blocks.
 *
 * Rule 2 is positional, so it cannot recover a plan that was relocated out from
 * between two prose blocks that ALSO have a sub-agent block between them; the
 * plan's original position is simply not in the state we are given. Closing
 * that would mean making `PLAN_UPDATE` replace in place instead of relocating —
 * a deliberate, separately-specified invariant on both sides of the wire.

 * wrong value then stuck until a full reload cleared localTurns and rendered
 * each parsed turn directly.
 *
 * A parse that hasn't caught up yet (fewer session turns than local) head-
 * aligns the turns it does have and leaves the rest unpatched, so a later
 * local reply never inherits an earlier one's stats and the caller's retry can
 * pick up the complete parse rather than lock in a stale value.
 *
 * `persistedAssistantCount` is the caller's send-time history baseline (see the
 * session's `historyAssistantBaseline`), so it is immune to a mid-stream detail
 * refetch folding this session's own partial into `detail`. `0` treats the

// `conversation://changed` side-channel only patches the sidebar list — not the
// open conversation's detail. So the viewer keeps rendering its stale detail
// (the prompt, no reply). The fix polls the persisted transcript on that nudge.
//
// The catch (verified against the backend): every turn-end signal
// (`conversation://changed` Status, `turn_complete`) fires off the ACP wire
// stop-reason, which RACES the agent CLI flushing its transcript JSONL. Detail
// is a live parse of whatever bytes are on disk, so a single refetch can still
// return the pre-reply transcript. We therefore poll a bounded number of times,
// backing off, and stop as soon as the transcript's last turn is no longer a
// trailing USER turn (Claude/Codex append the assistant reply to the JSONL only
// on completion, so a trailing user turn means the reply is still mid-flush).

// frame per batch, so a reply's `turn/end` — the record carrying its usage AND
// its completion clock — can stay unreadable for several seconds; a longer
// session makes the wait longer still). This used to be two attempts, 1.5s
// then 3s: past 4.5s the reply's footer simply stayed empty (no model, no
// tokens, no time) and every earlier reply of the session stayed unnameable —
// `source_turn_id` is only placeable while the parse is 1:1 with what this
// client streamed, so a parse that is still behind greys out their "fork from
// here" as "not ready yet" for good. Both only recovered by reopening the

//
// `localTurns` alone is NOT disqualifying: a viewer that streamed an EARLIER turn

// completed on the owner before this client observed the edge), so folding it
// from disk is safe. Excluding every `localTurns` would permanently strand such
// a viewer after its first captured turn — reproducing the very bug this sync
// fixes. Only a PROMOTED reply that may still be mid-flush (`completeTurn`'s ~8ms
// write race) must be protected, i.e. `localTurns.length > 0` AND either:
//   - `lastTurnOwned` — this client DROVE the promoted turn (an owner send); its
//     reply lives only in `localTurns` until the transcript catches up; or
//   - `liveOwnsActiveTurn` — a delegation-child dialog adopted its reply from the
//     wire ahead of persistence (see `sub-agent-session-dialog.tsx`, which then
//     deliberately does NOT refetch) and owns its promotion/dedup path.
// Both are gated on `localTurns.length > 0`: the pre-promotion streaming phase is
// already covered by `liveMessage`, and a MARKER-ONLY delegation child (the no-
// child-connection fallback that never streams or promotes) has nothing to guard,
// so it must stay eligible to sync on a later completion nudge. The synthesized
// viewer user turn lives in `optimisticTurns` WITHOUT `awaiting_persist`, so it
// never blocks a detail load from replacing it.
//
// Known limitation: a client that DROVE a turn and then passively MISSES every
// later turn (no live stream at all — a co-controlling client drove them) keeps
// `lastTurnOwned` set and stays excluded until a settled fetch (tab switch /
// reopen) clears its `localTurns`. This is deliberate: the alternative — admitting
// a session whose `localTurns` may hold an unflushed reply — reintroduces the
// hardware-evidenced content-drop `completeTurn` documents. The failure is safe

 * Rendering both duplicates the whole assistant turn (visible doubling +
 * React duplicate-key warnings once `mergeConsecutiveAssistantTurns`

 *   - ASSISTANT (and any non-user): keep the LAST occurrence. The live

 *     the prompt would render after its own streaming reply.
 * Real turns always have distinct ids (liveMessage.id is minted fresh per
 * prompt cycle, DB turn ids are unique), so a normal multi-turn timeline
 * has no collisions and is returned untouched.
 *
 * The key includes the role, not just the id, so the merge only ever
 * collapses entries that are genuinely the same turn (same id AND role).
 * Should two DIFFERENT-role turns ever share an id — only reachable via a
 * client id that collided into another namespace — they are kept separately
 * (a recoverable visible duplicate) instead of one silently overwriting the
 * other, which could hide a user prompt.

  // into `detail` it sits beside the live reply (a separate assistant turn
  // under a `live-…` id), and `mergeConsecutiveAssistantTurns` concatenates
  // the two — so the already-persisted head (e.g. the first reasoning block)
  // renders twice. Hide that persisted partial, but ONLY while the live message
  // is actually SHOWING a reply (`liveShowsReply`): that is what makes this a
  // choice between two renderings of one reply rather than a deletion. The
  // moment the turn ends, `liveMessage` clears and the persisted copy (now
  // complete) renders normally; the brief promote→refetch grace window can show
  // a transient visible duplicate, never a hidden turn.
  //
  // The in-flight prompt is identified authoritatively by the backend, which
  // reports the id of the persisted user turn it stamped as the in-flight one
  // (`detail.in_flight_user_turn_id`). This is robust where a frontend anchor
  // is not: the viewer's synthesized prompt may be suppressed (the persisted
  // copy already carries the broadcast id), and `liveMessage.startedAt` is the
  // client clock on the streaming path — neither can locate the prompt across
  // machines. When the new prompt isn't persisted yet the backend reports no
  // id, so an earlier completed round's reply is never mistaken for a partial.
  //
  // A mid-turn message used to take that id away, and the fallback below is
  // what is left of that. `apply_in_flight_message_id` matched the transcript
  // TAIL, so once the agent had written a steered message the tail was that
  // message, whose content is not the prompt's, and nothing was stamped — in
  // the middle of the round the suppression exists for. That is fixed at the
  // source now: the backend walks back over the turns of the running turn and
  // stamps the earliest copy of the prompt, which is the only reading that also
  // repairs `detailIsInFlight` (a mid-turn refetch clearing the live buffers)
  // and `collectInFlightPersistedToolCalls` (unfinished tool calls painting as
  // completed) — neither of which this file can reach.
  //
  // Kept as a BACKSTOP, and for grok as the only thing there is: `grok.rs`
  // parses its per-line `timestamp` as whole UNIX SECONDS, so a prompt the
  // agent persisted a few hundred milliseconds into the turn floors to an
  // instant BEFORE the (millisecond-precision) turn start and the backend's
  // recency gate refuses it. The stamp is therefore unreachable there however
  // the backend locates the prompt, and this is grok's round anchor. Fall back
  // to the
  // last persisted turn this client can still prove opened the round: the

 * the persisted user turns that the live stream is already showing as steered
 * messages. `null` when this turn steered nothing (the overwhelmingly common
 * case), so every caller below is free in an ordinary turn.
 *
 * The agent writes a steered message into its own transcript, so a detail
 * fetch that lands DURING the turn brings it back as an ordinary user turn —
 * under a parser id, which no id-keyed dedup can match to the live copy. Three
 * separate rules need to know which persisted turns those are:
 * `suppressPersistedSteeredPrompts` hides them, and the two round anchors in
 * `computeTimelinePrefix` must not mistake one for the start of a new round.
 *
 * Matched on CONTENT, the same way `APPEND_VIEWER_USER_TURN` reconciles the two
 * id namespaces of one prompt — but content ALONE cannot say which message it
 * matched. Steered text is short and repeatable ("continue", "stop", "not
 * done"), so a bare content match reaches back and finds the identical prompt
 * the user sent three rounds ago. Suppressing a user turn is the one failure
 * that hides a message rather than duplicating it, so the match is bounded by
 * WHEN:
 *
 *   - each `steering` block carries the note's `created_at`, taken on the
 *     agent's machine BEFORE the backend handed it the text (an invariant of
 *     `submit_feedback_native`);
 *   - the agent's copy is therefore written after it, so a persisted turn
 *     older than that instant is by construction a different message —
 *     including this round's own prompt, which the agent wrote before the user
 *     steered.
 *
 * Candidates are limited to turns the DETAIL projected, so every timestamp
 * compared comes from the agent's own clock; a promoted `localTurns` copy
 * (client clock, and kept across a mid-turn refetch by `preserveLive`) is never
 * a candidate. Anything unreadable — no parseable instant on either side —
 * matches nothing, leaving the two copies to coexist: a visible duplicate,
 * never a hidden message.
