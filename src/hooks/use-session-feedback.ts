/**
 * State + actions for the live-feedback ("steering") side channel, lifted out of
 * the old always-on composer bar. The user opens a dialog (from the composer
 * "+" menu) and sends a short note to the running agent; it is delivered the next
 * time the agent calls the `check_user_feedback` MCP tool. Sent notes render as
 * read-only rows above the composer, flipping from "waiting" to "received" once
 * the agent reads them.
 *
 * Cooperative by design: the agent must call the tool to see a note, so this is
 * a side channel, not a hard interrupt. If the turn ends between opening the
 * dialog and sending, the note is rerouted through the message queue
 * (`onResendAsPrompt`) so it is never silently dropped.
 *
 * A note the agent never got round to reading survives the turn it was written
 * for: at turn end the list keeps the still-`pending` rows and flips to its
 * expired form, which says the agent finished without reading them and offers
 * to resend each one as an ordinary message (`resendNote`) or drop it
 * (`dismissNote`). Delivered rows retire with the turn — they did their job.
 * Notes are turn-scoped either way: the next `user_message` clears the lot.
 *
 * State is hydrated from the session snapshot on mount / connection change (so a
 * refresh or a second mid-turn viewer recovers pending notes) and then kept live
 * via the `feedback_submitted` / `feedback_consumed` event stream. Consumed-id
 * tombstones reconcile a consume event that races ahead of hydration.
