 * `enabledIds` is forced empty (so no consumer can surface a default-dir link
 * as enabled) and skill UIs should hide their shortcuts rather than show a
 * dead-end "enable in Settings" path the Settings matrices also hide. pi is
 * held unsupported until the agent registry has loaded, so a custom-dir pi
