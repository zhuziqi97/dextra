// Built-in browser element picker. Injected by the Rust host into the
// ISOLATED world of one tab, ON DEMAND — when a person asks to point at
// something on the page and hand it to a conversation. Unlike `helper.js`
// this is not a document-start script: a page nobody picks on never pays for
// it, and it dies with the document, which is also how a navigation ends a
// pick nobody finished.
//
// While it is armed it draws a highlight over whatever the pointer is on and,
// on a click, reports that element to the host as one `pick` message. The
// press that chooses an element is swallowed in the capture phase, so
// choosing the page's "Delete" button does not also press it.
//
// The overlay is the one mark this leaves on the page: a fixed `div` with a
// CLOSED shadow root holding the highlight, so the page can see that a node
// exists but not read what is drawn in it. A plain `div` on
// purpose — a custom-element name the page has defined would be UPGRADED by
// its own constructor on `createElement`, and `ElementInternals.shadowRoot`
// hands a closed root to the element's own definition. There is no way to
// paint over a native webview from outside it — the host's own window is
// behind the page, not in front — so the overlay has to live in the document
// it describes.
//
// The overlay covers the WHOLE viewport and takes pointer events, and the
// element under the pointer is found by hit testing through it. That is what
// makes "choosing something does not press it" a property of the shape rather
// than a promise: the press is dispatched on the overlay, so the page's own
// element handlers never run, and events inside an `<iframe>` — which are
// dispatched in its window and never reach a listener here — cannot happen at
// all, because the pointer never reaches the frame.
//
// An earlier version covered only the frames, found by walking the page.
// Review took it apart four times over (ordering, budgets, shadow roots,
// `visibility: hidden`, ancestor clipping): any bounded enumeration can be
// filled with decoys by the page it is enumerating. Covering everything has
// no such surface.
//
// The cost is that the page does not scroll by itself while a pick is armed,
// so `wheel` is forwarded by hand to whatever the pointer is over.
//
// What is NOT closed, and cannot be from in here: a page that registered its
// own capture listener on `window` before this script was injected runs
// first, and may act on the press or stop it reaching this one. Nothing
// evaluated into a page after its scripts have run can get in front of them;
// closing it would need the press to be intercepted by the engine, which is
// where a browser's own inspector does it and where we have no hook. Since
// the press lands on the overlay, what such a listener sees is a press on an
// element that is not the page's own.
//
// Everything it reports is page-controlled and goes on to a model as DATA:
// every field is capped here and again in the host (`browser/handoff.rs`),
// and the host's renderer marks the whole thing as page content rather than
// instruction.
