/**
 * The window's answer to "a local server just started".
 *
 * The backend watches every terminal it runs — the terminal panel, canvas
 * cards, and the terminals agents ask it to run — and says so on
 * `browser://service-detected` once per terminal per address, having first
 * established that the address is a loopback one and that something is
 * listening on it. What to do about that is a preference
 * (`browser:service-auto-open`), and this is the only place that reads it.
 *
 * Mounted beside `BrowserEventsBridge` rather than inside it: that one
 * returns early where no built-in browser exists, and this is useful in web
 * mode too, where a loopback address reaches the dextra-server's port bridge.
 *
 * Three things it deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 * - **Launch the system browser.** Where the link decision says `system`
 *   (someone set terminal links to open there) the notice is raised instead:
 *   a browser window taking over the desktop is not something software should
 *   do without a person pressing something.
 * - **Say anything about a blocked address.** A site rule refusing a host is
 *   an answer the user already gave; repeating it as a toast every time a
 *   server starts would be nagging.
 * - **Dedupe across restarts.** That is the backend's job and it does it per
 *   terminal, so a watcher reprinting its banner is quiet while the same
 *   address started from a second terminal is a new thing to hear about.
