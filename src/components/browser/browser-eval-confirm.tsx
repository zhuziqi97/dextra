/**
 * The question `browser_eval` puts to a person: this code, on this site, once.
 *
 * Mounted next to the browser event bridge rather than inside a tab, because
 * the tab the question is about is very often not the one on screen — an agent
 * works on a page while its user reads the conversation.
 *
 * It is raised only for someone who asked for it: `evalApproval` in Settings →
 * Built-in browser is `silent` by default, and this component answers "yes" for
 * them without showing anything. The decision it stands in for is made on the
 * `browser_eval` tool switch, which ships off and whose own text says that
 * turning it on means code runs without asking. What this component does NOT
 * decide is whether anything may run at all: that switch and the tab's
 * `control` grant are enforced in the backend and are not reachable from here,
 * and a silent run is still recorded on that tab's activity strip.
 *
 * What the dialog is for, when there is one, is that the person reads the code.
 * So it shows all of it, verbatim, unhighlighted and unsummarised, and the
 * backend has already refused anything longer than someone could reasonably
 * read. Nothing here abbreviates, and no answer is ever carried from one
 * snippet to the next: somebody who turned this dialog ON wants each snippet,
 * so an "always allow" button beside the code would undo the only thing they
 * asked for.
 *
 * Refusing is the default in every direction — Escape, the focused button
 * (Radix focuses Cancel in an alert dialog), the window going away, and simply
 * running out of time.
