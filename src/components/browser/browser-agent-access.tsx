 * The one place a person hands a page to an agent, and the running account of

 * for the decision, the right end for the record of what it let happen.
 *
 * Two levels are offered, `read` and `control`, as two entries of one menu:
 * reading a page cannot change it, acting on it can, and they are different
 * decisions for the person to make. A shared tab can be moved between the two
 * without being taken back first.
 *
 * The settings' default (`defaultAgentGrant` in `browser-prefs`) has usually
 * answered this already — `browser-agent-grant.ts` applies it to every site a
 * tab arrives at — so the unshared menu below is what a person sees on a site
 * they took the grant back on, or with the default set to share nothing. It
 * still opens onto that default, and says which entry it is.

 * every page down by 28px the moment an agent first touched the tab (so a
 * viewport an agent had just measured stopped being true), and it stayed

 * plus a disclosure.
 *
 * Shown whenever there is anything to show — including on a tab nobody
 * shared, where every line is a refusal. That is the case worth surfacing
 * most: an agent reaching for a page it was never given is invisible
 * otherwise, since the only party told about it is the agent. Which is why
 * the closed button carries the same three glyphs the band did, and why the
 * one it shows is the newest line that did NOT go as asked rather than the
 * newest line: from the closed state that mark is all there is, and a refusal
 * followed by one successful read would otherwise take it back off while the
 * refusal was still in the list. The cost of that choice is that the closed
 * control stops naming the newest attempt once anything is flagged — which is
 * the right way round, since "an agent was refused here" outranks "and then it
 * read the page thirty more times", and the list says both.
