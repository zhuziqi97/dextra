"use client"

/**
 * Owns the transcript's side-panel viewers — the "查看会话" drawers and the
 * file viewer — ABOVE the virtual list.
 *
 * The cards that offer those viewers — `DelegatedSubThread` for a
 * `delegate_to_agent` call, `AgentToolCallPart` for a grok `spawn_subagent` —
 * render inside `VirtualizedMessageThread`'s rows. They used to hold the
 * viewer's open state and render the drawer themselves, which meant scrolling
 * the card out of virtua's buffer unmounted the row and took the open drawer
 * down with it. Hoisting the state and the drawer to `MessageListView` (which
 * renders the virtualizer, not a row inside it) is what decouples the two.
 *
 * Nesting is unaffected: the viewer's own transcript renders another
 * `MessageListView`, which provides its own host, so a grandchild viewer still
 * mounts inside the parent drawer's React tree and Base UI still stacks it.
 *
 * ONE request slot, not one per kind. Two viewers open at the same level would
 * be same-width siblings with no stacking relationship between them — one
 * flatly covering the other, which reads as a glitch. Opening a second viewer
 * therefore replaces the first. That is also why the FILE viewer lives here
 * rather than in a host of its own: a file opened from a transcript is one
 * more thing this transcript is showing off to the side, and it has to stack
 * over (or replace) whatever else the transcript already put there.
