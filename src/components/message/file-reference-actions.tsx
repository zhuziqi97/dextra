/**
 * Wraps an inline file badge in the transcript (user messages via

 * relative path, copy absolute path, and — where the file lives on another host
 * — download it. A non-file target renders its children untouched, with no menu
 * attached.
 *
 * A context menu (not a hover popover, and not a click target of its own) is
 * what leaves the badge's own behaviour intact: a left click still opens the
 * file in the workspace panel, reading past a file name pops nothing, and Radix
 * gives the long-press gesture on touch, keyboard navigation and Escape for
 * free.
 *
 * The conversation panel wraps the whole transcript in its own context menu
 * (copy text / new conversation / export / …, see
 * conversations/conversation-detail-panel.tsx), so the badge's trigger STOPS the
 * event from bubbling — otherwise both menus open at once. Right-clicking a file
 * name is therefore about that file; right-clicking anywhere else in the
 * transcript still gets the conversation menu.
