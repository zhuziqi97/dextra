 *
 * Deliberately request-free. The sidebar card holds only a
 * `DbConversationSummary`, and everything here comes from it or from the
 * workspace store, so the bubble paints the instant it opens. Token usage and
 * the session/extension ids are NOT shown: those need a
 * `getFolderConversation` round-trip per conversation, which is what the
 * right-click "Session Details" dialog (`SessionDetailsContent`) is for.
 *
 * Subscribing to the store here is safe even though one card renders per
 * visible sidebar row: Radix mounts hover-card content only while open, so at
 * most one of these exists at a time. (Contrast the card body itself, which
 * reads `useTabStore` imperatively precisely to avoid a per-row subscription.)
