 * - The "Pinned" section header + its conversations appear only when `pinned`
 *   is non-empty, and its rows only when `pinnedExpanded`.
 * - The "Folders" section header ALWAYS appears (like "Chat"), so the section
 *   stays a permanent entry point — its Open-folder / Clone / Import actions stay
 *   reachable even with nothing open. Its rows appear only when `foldersExpanded`:
 *   when expanded with no open folders it contributes a single `folders-empty`
 *   hint row; otherwise its folder rows follow `orderedFolderIds`: a collapsed
 *   folder contributes only its header; an expanded empty folder contributes
 *   header + one (per-folder) empty-hint row; an expanded non-empty folder

 *   section), so a folder whose only conversations are pinned reads as empty. The
 *   fully-empty initial workspace (no folders AND no conversations) never reaches
 *   buildRows — the list renders its dedicated open-folder call-to-action there.
 * - The "Chat" section header ALWAYS appears (even with zero chat
 *   conversations), so the section is a permanent entry point — its New-chat
 *   affordance and an empty hint stay reachable. When expanded and empty it
 *   contributes a single `chats-empty` hint row; otherwise its (flat, folderless)
 *   conversation rows. Pinned chat conversations live in the Pinned section, so
 *   they are excluded from `chatConversations`.
 * - The "Recent" section contributes NOTHING AT ALL (not even a header) unless
 *   `showRecent` — it is the one section the user can switch off, and a
 *   permanently-visible header for a hidden section would defeat that. When
 *   shown it mirrors the Chat section: header always, then either a single
 *   `recent-empty` hint or its flat conversation rows. Its rows are tagged

 * of the Chat and Recent sections belong to no folder, so without this reset
 * they would inherit the last folder of the Folders section and keep its sticky
 * header pinned over a list it has nothing to do with.
 *
 * A FOLDER-GROUP header ends it for the same reason, one level down: the group
