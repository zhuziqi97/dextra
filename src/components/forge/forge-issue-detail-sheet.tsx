/**
 * Typography for the item's Markdown body at the panel's scale.
 *
 * Streamdown sizes its own elements for the full-width chat column — `h1` at
 * `text-3xl`, 24px above every heading — which in a 36rem panel turns a
 * three-heading issue into a page of titles. A descendant selector outranks the
 * class Streamdown puts on the element itself, so these win without
 * `!important`. The first/last block's collapsed margin comes from
 * `MessageResponse`; `prose` is deliberately absent, as the repo has no
 * typography plugin and those classes would generate nothing.
 *
 * The list indent is an override rather than an addition: `MessageResponse`
 * sets `pl-3`, which puts an outside bullet almost on the text's own left edge,
 * so a nested list reads as one flat column. That is also why this goes to the
 * renderer's `className` and NOT onto a wrapper around it — from a wrapper the
 * two rules would be descendant selectors of equal specificity, settled by
 * whatever order Tailwind happened to emit them in; on the renderer, `cn` drops
 * the one it replaces before either reaches the stylesheet.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the task sheet's `RESULT_MARKDOWN`, which is tuned a notch
 * smaller: there the Markdown is a summary sitting among other sections, here it
 * is the whole reason the panel opened and has to stay comfortable to read at
 * length. Images are capped because an issue body is full of screenshots and
 * the forge writes them at their natural width.

            to the end of the very thing you were trying to scroll sideways.
            Bounded, both bars sit on the edges of the box you can see.

            Its 500-row cap and "show the remaining N lines" reveal are the same
            either way, which is what keeps a lockfile from freezing the panel.

/**
 * Right-side detail panel for one issue / pull request.
 *
 * It replaces what the row's title used to do — leave the app for the forge's
 * own web page — because everything a triage pass needs is already in the list
 * payload: the body rides along with every row (see `ForgeIssueRow::body`), so
 * the panel draws instantly, and the list underneath keeps its filters, its
 * page and its scroll position. The panel is the same drawer the task board
 * uses, at the same width, for the same reason those all share
 * `SIDE_PANEL_CONTENT_CLASS`: they stack on one another.
 *
 * The discussion is the one thing that does cost a request (see
 * [`CommentThread`]) — it is not in the list payload and could not be, because
 * a list page holds thirty items whose reader opens at most one. A pull
 * request costs one more (see [`useChangeDetail`]), for the same reason, and a
 * third once its files are looked at (see [`ChangedFiles`]).
 *
 * A CHANGE is read through three tabs, an issue through one scroll. That is not
 * a symmetry worth having: an issue has no checks and no files, so its tab bar
 * would be one tab wide and say nothing — while a change without them queues
 * its CI and its file list behind a discussion that pages, in a 36rem panel.
 *
 * It also WRITES: a comment, and the item's open/closed state. Both go through
 * the backend's own account resolution and both adopt the forge's answer
 * rather than a local guess — see `forge_create_comment_core` and
 * `forge_set_item_state_core`.
