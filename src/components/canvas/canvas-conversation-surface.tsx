/**
 * A live conversation rendered INSIDE a canvas card: transcript, composer,
 * streaming reply, permission / question / plan-approval prompts, and the
 * mode & config selectors.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT `ConversationTabView` (conversation-detail-panel.tsx),
 * which is welded to the tab store — it resolves its folder from its own tab
 * row, binds drafts through `bindConversationTab`, and pins/closes tabs. A
 * canvas card has no tab. Instead this composes the SAME primitives that view
 * is built from, so the behaviour that matters is shared code rather than a
 * copy:
 *
 *   `useConnectionLifecycle`  connect / send / cancel / respond-permission
 *   `useConversationDetail`   the persisted transcript
 *   `registerLiveMessageSink` streaming deltas → the runtime store
 *   `MessageListView`         the transcript (reads turns by conversation id)
 *   `ConversationShell`       composer + the three interrupt dialogs
 *
 * What it deliberately leaves out: the message queue, live-feedback steering,
 * transcript export and the welcome-page quick actions. Those belong
 * to the full workspace surface, which the card's "open in workspace" menu
 * entry is one click away from.
 *
 * `contextKey` is the ACP connection key and must be STABLE for the card's
 * lifetime; when this conversation is also open in a workspace tab, the two
 * keys differ and the second one attaches to the first's connection as a
 * co-controlling viewer (see the discovery gate in `acp-connections-context`).

   * Re-entry repair: let the database have the last word on a session this
   * card is coming back to.
   *
   * The canvas is a full-page route, so leaving it for the tasks or token page
   * UNMOUNTS every card, while the workspace's own tabs are merely hidden. A
   * card therefore has to survive its conversation moving on without it, and
   * the runtime session it leaves behind does not:
   *
   *   - the live-message sink is registered by THIS component, so `liveMessage`
   *     stops advancing the instant the card unmounts while the agent keeps
   *     streaming. The global `turn_complete` handler that promotes turns for
   *     conversations with no tab open then drains that frozen partial into
   *     `localTurns`, where it masks the complete persisted reply;
   *   - `awaiting_persist`, pinned by the send, is cleared only by a completion
   *     this client observed — a turn that ends unwatched, or dies with its
   *     connection and emits no completion at all, leaves it pinned with the
   *     optimistic user turn duplicated underneath;
   *   - and `useConversationDetail` never re-fetches a detail it already holds,
   *     so none of it heals. Collapsing and re-expanding the card, or coming
   *     back tomorrow, shows the same truncated transcript until the app
   *     restarts.
   *
   * Unpinning `awaiting_persist` first is what lets `FETCH_DETAIL_SUCCESS`
   * replace those buffers, and it re-arms the `SET_LIVE_MESSAGE` guard against
   * the settled replay a reconnect pushes — which is why this effect is
   * declared ABOVE the sink registration below, whose setup replays that very
   * message. It is gated on this card's own connection not being the one
   * prompting, because then the send really is still in flight. A turn running
   * anywhere ELSE is protected by the fetch itself: the backend stamps
   * `in_flight_user_turn_id` on a mid-turn detail and the reducer keeps every
   * live buffer for those — so a reply streaming in right now survives this
   * untouched, and only a settled one is replaced.
   *
   * The one state neither guard covers is a prompt that has left `handleSend`
   * but not yet reached the backend: `sendPrompt` does not set `prompting`
   * optimistically, and the detail cannot be marked in-flight for a turn nobody
   * has been told about. Re-entering THERE would clear the optimistic echo of a
   * message that is on its way. Reaching it means leaving the canvas and coming
   * back inside a single `acp_prompt` round trip — two deliberate navigations,
   * milliseconds apart — and the message itself is not lost either way, since
   * the backend goes on to persist it and the next fetch shows it. Closing it
   * would take a send timestamp the runtime store does not keep; it is left
   * open knowingly rather than by omission.
   *
   * Latching after ONE pass — even a pass that found the card's own connection
   * prompting and so left the pin alone — is likewise deliberate. This is the
   * fallback for turns that ended while the card was ABSENT; a turn that ends
   * while it is MOUNTED is settled by the prompting → idle edge below, which
   * fires for a connection that was removed as readily as one that finished
   * (`useConnection` reports a missing entry as `status: null`). Retrying here
   * would only race that.
