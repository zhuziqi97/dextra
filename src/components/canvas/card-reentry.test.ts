/**
 * What an expanded conversation card has to do when the board it lives on comes
 * back.
 *
 * The canvas is a full-page route: `WorkbenchRoutePage` renders the active page
 * or nothing, so leaving for the tasks or token page UNMOUNTS every card, while
 * the workspace's own conversation tabs are only hidden behind it. That makes a
 * card the one live-conversation surface that routinely disappears while its
 * conversation keeps working, and both halves of coming back have to be handled
 * explicitly — what the store is left holding, and what the connection is.
 *
 * The store half is covered behaviourally in
 * `stores/runtime-canvas-reentry.test.ts`; these are the wiring assertions for
 * the callers, read from source because neither `CanvasView` nor the surface
 * mounts without a ReactFlow store, the canvas provider and the whole chat
 * stack — the same reason `draft-card-handover.test.ts` is written this way.
