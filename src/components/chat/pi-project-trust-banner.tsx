/**
 * Per-conversation banner + dialog for pi's PROJECT TRUST decision.
 *
 * pi loads a repo's own `.pi/*` — settings, skills, prompts, themes, system-prompt
 * overrides, and `.pi/extensions`, which are JS/TS modules whose top level runs at
 * pi startup with the user's permissions — but only once the workspace is trusted
 * in pi's `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`. Because pi-acp spawns `pi --mode rpc` (no UI),
 * pi cannot ask, and its own default is to skip those resources.
 *
 * dextra used to write that trust automatically on every pi launch, which silently
 * answered "yes" on the user's behalf — so merely opening a conversation on a
 * cloned repo executed whatever it shipped in `.pi/extensions`. That is gone; the
 * decision now surfaces here instead.
 *
 * Two cases reach the user, because removing the auto-seeding does not undo what
 * it already wrote:
 * - UNDECIDED — nothing covers this folder, so pi is skipping the resources.
 *   Asks for a decision.
 * - ALREADY TRUSTED, not yet acknowledged — a grant is in force, possibly one an
 *   older dextra wrote without asking, and possibly inherited from an ancestor it
 *   seeded (which covers repos cloned into that ancestor long afterwards). Those
 *   entries can't be told apart from the user's own pi decisions, so they aren't
 *   pruned; instead this discloses the grant, names the deciding folder, and
 *   offers to revoke. Because pi runs extensions at startup, a warning shown
 *   after connecting would come too late — so the backend REFUSES to launch pi
 *   while such a grant stands (`pi_project_trust_launch_block`), and answering
 *   here is what releases it. The answer is recorded on the backend, which is
 *   what enforces the gate; pi's own file is untouched by "keep trusted".
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * - Only for pi, and only when the repo actually ships trust-gated resources.
 * - Owners only — viewers and delegation children don't own the backend process,
 *   so neither the decision nor the restart is theirs to make. Same rule as
 *   `SessionConfigStaleBanner`, whose layout and restart mechanics this mirrors.
 * - Renders with or without a live connection, since the gate's whole job is to
 *   stop the connection from existing until this is answered.
 * - Every answer restarts pi, because it resolves trust once at process startup:
 *   granting so the resources load, revoking so they stop being loaded, and
 *   acknowledging so the launch the gate refused can finally happen.
 * - The X dismisses for this session only, and never implies a decision: an
 *   undecided project stays undecided, which is the safe state. Dismissing the
 *   disclosure does NOT acknowledge it, so it returns next session.
 *
 * Returns null (no layout impact) when there's nothing to decide.
