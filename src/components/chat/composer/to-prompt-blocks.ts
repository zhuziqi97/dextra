/**
 * Send serialization: turn the (plain-text) composer document into the prose
 * portion of a `PromptInputBlock[]`. (Out-of-band image / embedded-byte
 * attachments are appended by the host's `buildDraft`; this function owns only
 * the editor doc.)
 *
 * The composer holds only prose, hard breaks, and inline reference badges (no
 * Markdown formatting), so serialization is a single plain-text walk:
 *
 * - **text** nodes contribute their literal characters (a `# `, `**x**`, `- ` a
 *   user typed stays verbatim — the transcript renders it verbatim too).
 * - **reference** badges (EXCEPT embedded) contribute their inline token via
 *   {@link referenceToMarkdown}: file → `[label](file://uri)`, session/commit/
 *   agent → their link/`@` form, skill → `/id`·`$id`. This is unchanged from the
 *   old Markdown path — the wire format the backend's `user_blocks_from_prompt`
 *   and reload adapter expect — so nothing downstream (or already persisted)
 *   changes. Kept **inline, in place** so a cold reload reparses each badge at
 *   its original position.
 * - **embedded** references (a `dextra://embedded/…` display uri for path-less
 *   pasted bytes) are dropped: their real bytes-bearing block is appended
 *   separately by the host's `buildDraft`, so emitting their synthetic display
 *   link here would leak a uri the agent shouldn't see.
 * - **hard breaks** and paragraph boundaries become `\n`.
 *
 * The whole document serializes to a single text block, with every reference
 * sitting inline exactly where the sender placed it.
