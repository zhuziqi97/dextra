 * receive Markdown. Shown raw that's a wall of `>`; shown as a rule it reads
 * like the transcript does.
 *
 * This is a DECORATION, never a schema change. Adding a blockquote node would
 * change what `serializeDocToText` walks, what the clipboard round-trips, and —
 * worst — what `setContent` does to drafts saved by an older build (an unknown
 * node type silently wipes the whole document; see `composer-draft-sanitize.ts`).
 * Decorations touch none of that: the two characters stay in the document, still
 * occupy their width, and still delete with two backspaces. The CSS only makes
 * their glyphs transparent and draws the rule in their place — so what the user
 * sends, copies and re-opens is byte-for-byte what it was before.
 *
 * Recomputed only when the document actually changes; otherwise the previous
 * set (which is bound to the same doc) is reused.
