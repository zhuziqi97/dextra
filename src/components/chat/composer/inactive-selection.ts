/**
 * Keep the text selection visible after the editor loses focus.
 *
 * When focus moves to an overlay that preserves the selection — most visibly the
 * composer's custom right-click menu, whose radix content takes focus — browsers
 * stop painting the active selection: Chromium/Firefox dim it to a faint
 * "inactive" colour, and WebKit (the macOS desktop webview) drops it entirely,
 * so a CSS `::selection` rule has nothing left to restyle. This extension paints
 * the selection itself instead: while the editor is blurred it decorates the
 * current `state.selection` (which survives blur — it only changes via
 * transactions) with {@link INACTIVE_SELECTION_CLASS}, a normal element
 * background that renders regardless of focus or platform.
 *
 * The decoration exists only while blurred, so a focused editor keeps its native
 * selection untouched and editing / IME are never affected. Focus is tracked in
 * plugin state, toggled by a meta-only transaction (no doc change → no
 * `onUpdate` / draft save) from the editor's own focus/blur events.
