/**
 * The hover hint on a selector chip (model / config option / mode / agent /
 * folder / the collapsed agent-settings cog), replacing the native `title`.
 * Shared by the chat composer, the automation editor and the task editor.
 *
 * Says what the chip IS, not what it currently holds — the value is already the
 * chip's own text, so repeating it here would just be a second copy under the
 * cursor.
 *
 * Hover-only, deliberately: Radix opens a tooltip on focus too, and every one
 * of these triggers hands focus BACK to itself when its menu closes — so
 * picking a model would leave a hint stranded over the composer. `onFocus`'s
 * `preventDefault()` suppresses that (Radix composes trigger handlers with
 * `checkForDefaultPrevented`, so a prevented event skips its internal open).
 * Nothing is lost for keyboard/AT users' orientation: every trigger keeps its
 * `aria-label`. (A `description` is mouse-only, which is why it carries colour,
 * not meaning.)
 *
 * ⚠️ Do NOT style a wrapped trigger on `data-[state=open]`. `TooltipTrigger`
 * sets its own `data-state` and spreads incoming props after it, so the tooltip
 * state lands on the DOM node and shadows the menu/popover trigger's. Drive
 * such styling from the React state that already owns the popup.
 *
 * The rendered tree shape is deliberately constant — the hint is switched off
 * by gating `open`, never by returning `children` bare. Swapping between the
 * two shapes remounts the trigger, and a pill that gains/loses its hint on
 * click (the agent selector) would drop keyboard focus mid-interaction.
