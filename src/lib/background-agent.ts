/**
 * Background-task lifecycle for the Agent tool card.
 *
 * The Claude parser rewrites an async sub-agent launch ack's output — internal
 * metadata text never meant for users — into a structured marker payload
 * (`BACKGROUND_TASK_MARKER` + one-line JSON), joined with the latest matching
 * `<task-notification>` from the same transcript (see
 * `ClaudeRecordAccumulator::finalize_background_lifecycle` in
 * `src-tauri/src/parsers/claude.rs`). This module is the frontend side of that
 * contract.
 *
 * A `null` status means no notification has been observed in the transcript —
 * deliberately rendered as "launched · result pending", NEVER as "running":
 * the transcript alone cannot distinguish a still-running task from one whose
 * CLI died (the zombie-"running" trap). Live "running" presentation is only
 * derived from the in-flight wire ack text (`isAsyncLaunchAckText`), which by
 * construction only exists inside a live session.

 * the `background_activity` overlay turns which `applyStreamingAction`'s
 * out-of-turn guard defers to when it drops wire content outside a prompting
 * turn. For every other agent the guard drops that content with no producer
 * behind it, so nothing renders until the transcript is re-read.
 *
 * Keep in sync with `spawn_if_claude`: arming the watcher for another agent
 * without adding it here makes that agent render its background work twice.
