"use client"

/**
 * Remembers what each agent CALLS its models, so a surface holding nothing but
 * a raw model id can show the name the user picked it by.
 *
 * Most agents name a model with a string a human can read — `claude-opus-5`,
 * `gpt-5.1-codex` — so the id and the label are the same thing and this store
 * stays empty. Qoder is the case that needs it: its transcripts record the
 * account-internal key (`qfmodel`), while the name it advertises over ACP for
 * that same key is `Qwen3.8-Flash`. The composer's model selector reads the
 * advertised name, the reply footer reads the transcript, and the two disagreed
 * on screen.
 *
 * Keyed by agent type rather than globally: generic ids like `auto` or
 * `default` mean different things under different agents, and a single table
 * would let one agent relabel another's model.
 *
 * Persisted because history has to render without a live session — the
 * transcript is on disk long after the connection that named its model is gone.
 * Entries are MERGED, never replaced: an account whose model catalog shrinks
 * should not lose the label for a model its older sessions still reference.
 *
 * `Map`, not a plain object, at BOTH levels. Agent types and model ids are
 * strings dextra does not choose, and a plain object inherits `Object.prototype`
 * — so `labels["__proto__"]` answers with the prototype instead of `undefined`,
 * the caller's `?? rawId` fallback never fires, and a React text slot is handed
 * an object to render (which throws). Restoring from JSON has the mirror
 * problem: `out[agentType] = …` with the key `__proto__` RE-PARENTS the map
 * instead of adding to it, so one crafted storage entry answers lookups for
 * every other agent. A `Map` has neither hazard.
