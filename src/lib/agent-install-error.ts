/**
 * Recognizes known agent install/upgrade/uninstall failure signatures so the
 * UI can show a clear, localized hint the user can act on, instead of the raw
 * CLI error text.
 *
 * Primary case (Windows): dextra keeps an agent's process alive for session
 * reuse. On Windows the running process holds file locks on its own files
 * inside the npm / Volta global package directory, so a reinstall can't remove
 * the old package dir to upgrade or uninstall — npm/Volta surface this as
 * "Could not remove directory" / EPERM / EBUSY (and it fails even as admin,
 * because it's a sharing violation, not a permissions problem). The fix the
 * user needs is simply to close the running sessions and retry.
 *
 * This module only classifies the error and returns a translation key; the
 * caller renders it via its own `useTranslations("AcpAgentSettings")` so the
 * key stays type-checked against the message catalog. The rule list is
 * ordered; the first match wins. Add new entries here as other recognizable
 * failures come up.
