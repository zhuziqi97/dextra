 * "Ask about this selection" hand-off: the selection bubble composes a prompt
 * (quoted selection + the user's question), opens a fresh conversation draft
 * tab, and parks the prompt here for THAT tab's panel to pick up and send.
 *
 * A module-level buffer rather than a bare CustomEvent, and keyed by tab id
 * rather than broadcast, for two reasons:
 *  - the target draft tab may still be mounting (a brand-new tab), so an event
 *    alone would fire before anyone is listening — the panel drains on mount;
 *  - each split group reuses ONE draft tab, so the target may equally be mounted
 *    already (inactive tabs stay mounted, hidden) — hence the event as the
 *    already-mounted fast path.
 * Keying by tab id is what keeps a second group's draft panel from swallowing a
 * prompt meant for the first. Mirrors the `task-compose-events` idiom.

   * that window the tab still looks — and, if it was already connected, still
   * behaves — like the old folder/agent: self-consistently ready, so neither the

   * Draining then would deliver the question to the WRONG agent, in the wrong
   * workspace. Matching on the promised identity holds the prompt until the
