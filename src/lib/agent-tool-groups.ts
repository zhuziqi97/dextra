/**
 * How dextra's own tool groups are named and drawn, in one table.
 *
 * Two surfaces render this list: the dextra-mcp popover in the bottom-right of
 * the workspace (`components/layout/status-bar-mcp.tsx`) and the "tools an
 * agent may use" panel in Collaboration settings
 * (`components/settings/agent-tools-settings.tsx`). They used to hold a table
 * each, in two message namespaces, and had drifted into calling three of the
 * same switches by different names — which reads as three switches that are
 * not the same switch. One table, one namespace: the drift is not a bug to fix
 * again, it is a shape that cannot happen.
 *
 * The keys are the slugs the backend reports in `tool_groups` (and the
 * `--features` slugs the companion parses), so a group added backend-first
 * shows up with its raw slug rather than throwing.
 *
 * Message keys are written out in full because next-intl only resolves
 * literal keys — a computed `` t(`${slug}.label`) `` compiles but is not
 * checked, and an unchecked key is one rename away from a missing-message
 * error in ten languages at once.
