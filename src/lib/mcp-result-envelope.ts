/**
 * Peel the host envelopes that wrap an MCP `CallToolResult` on its way to a
 * tool card.
 *
 * codex-acp forwards EVERY MCP tool call's outcome to the ACP wire as
 *   `rawOutput = { result: <CallToolResult> | null, error: <string> | null }`
 * (its `createMcpRawOutput`), and codex's own rollout tags the same result under
 * a serde `{ Ok: … }` variant. Neither layer is part of the result the dextra-mcp
 * companion actually returned, so a card that reads a companion result has to
 * strip them first — otherwise the whole envelope falls through as opaque text
 * and the card renders raw JSON instead of the report inside it.
 *
 * The peel is deliberately narrow: a tool result is only ever a *child agent's*
 * arbitrary payload away from being mangled, so both the destination and the
 * failure case are positively identified (a `CallToolResult` under the wrapper
 * key; a `result`-bearing envelope for the error string) rather than pattern-
 * matched on key names alone. A payload that merely happens to own a `result` or
 * `error` key is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * `ask-question.ts::parseOutcomeJson` peels the same layers inline for its own
 * shapes; this module is the reusable form for the delegation cards.
