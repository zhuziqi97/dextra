// view so the existing look is unchanged until the user opts in.

// previews at once (one per Edit/Write tool call in a transcript, plus any
// permission dialog stacked on top). Reading localStorage once per instance
// would leave every already-mounted sibling on the old layout until it
// remounted, so the toggle broadcasts and each preview subscribes — the same
// shape `office-preview-prefs` uses for its cross-surface toggle.
