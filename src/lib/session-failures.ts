/**
 * AIR typed session-failure projection helpers.
 *
 * The wire (`session_failure` events / the snapshot's `session_failures`
 * table) carries UPSERTS ONLY — see `SessionFailureRecord` in `lib/types`.
 * These helpers implement the client half of the contract, shared by the
 * connections reducer (live events + snapshot hydrate) so it matches the
 * backend's `SessionState::apply_event` byte for byte:
 *
 * - monotonic per-id merge: a record is accepted only when its revision is
 *   STRICTLY greater than the stored one (equal = verbatim replay, e.g.
 *   claude re-publishing still-active failures on session/load). Accepted
 *   upserts re-arm `resolved` — id reuse with a bumped revision is how codex
 *   escalates a retry warning into the turn's terminal error, and how a
 *   settled incident legitimately recurs. The ONE place this is looser than
 *   `apply_event` is an equal-revision record carrying `resolved: true`: that
 *   bit is client-inferred rather than adapter-published, so a snapshot must
 *   be able to hand it to a client that missed the events it came from. The
 *   backend needs no counterpart — nothing upstream ever sends IT a
 *   resolution.
 * - inferred resolution: adapters never publish resolve/tombstone, so the
 *   client settles records itself — RETRY INCIDENTS as soon as the turn makes
 *   progress again, any remaining severity-"warning" record at the turn
 *   boundary (mirroring the retry banner's clear-at-turn-end), and EVERYTHING
 *   when the user starts a new prompt (acting past an error acknowledges it;
 *   a still-real failure comes back with a higher revision).
 *
 * Entries are retained after resolution — each doubles as its id's revision
 * watermark, so a delayed stale upsert can never resurrect a settled record.
 * Kept dependency-free for unit testing without the context harness.
