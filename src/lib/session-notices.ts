/**
 * ACP Session Notice presentation (`session_notice` events).
 *
 * A notice is fire-and-forget advisory text: no id, no lifecycle, no position
 * in the history. It is a NOTIFICATION — a toast, kept in the status-bar alert
 * list when it is a warning or an error (see `lib/notify`) — and never also a
 * strip under the composer, because the same sentence on the screen twice at
 * once reads as two problems. The composer dock is kept for what is in
 * progress (an upstream the adapter is reconnecting to).
 *
 * Kept dependency-free so the routing rules are unit-testable without the
 * connections provider.
