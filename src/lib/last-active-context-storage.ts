/** Lightweight, device-local hint describing where the user last had focus while
 *  it was still an unsent draft. Persisted so a fresh launch can restore the
 *  *same* folder (or chat mode) instead of a blank workspace — without ever
 *  writing a conversation/folder DB row (the delayed-persistence invariant: rows
 *  are created only on first send).
 *
 *  The agent is intentionally NOT persisted: the recovered draft resolves its
 *  agent exactly like any new conversation (the folder's default, then the usual
 *  availability fallback), which avoids laundering a provisional cold-start guess
 *  into an explicit choice. `folderId` is `0` for chat mode (the folderless
 *  sentinel) and goes unused there since `isChat` is checked first.
 *
 *  Authoritative tab state remains the synced `opened_tabs`; this hint is
 *  advisory and resolves last-writer-wins across windows. */
