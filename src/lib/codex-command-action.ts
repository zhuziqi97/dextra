/**
 * codex-acp "command action" tool calls.
 *
 * When codex classifies a shell command as a known action (read / search /
 * list-files), codex-acp announces it as an ACP `tool_call` carrying ONLY a
 * human title — no `rawInput` at all (`createCommandActionEvent`) — and later
 * completes it with `rawOutput: { formatted_output, exit_code }`. The query and
 * the path therefore exist nowhere but the title, so both the tool-name
 * classifier and the live input synthesis have to read them back out of it.
 *
 * The title shapes are codex-acp's `createSearchTitle` / list-files literals.
 * Note the asymmetric quoting — the search path is NOT quoted, every other
 * interpolation is:
 *
 *   Search for '<query>' in <path>
 *   Search for '<query>'
 *   Search in '<path>'
 *   Search
 *   List files in '<path>'
 *   List files
 *   Read file '<path>'            ← resolved elsewhere (`^read` freeform rule)

 * for grep-likes — for the list-files commands that classify as `glob`
 * (ls/find/…) it is a genuine failure, and a successful empty listing already
 * arrives with exit 0. The tool-name gate lives at the call sites because
 * `tool-call-normalization` imports this module, not the other way round.
 *
 * Whitespace-only output counts as empty, matching `<SearchResultsOutput>`,
 * which renders any blank body as "No matches" — a shell that echoes a bare
 * newline must not flip the same result between the neutral and the error
 * rendering. A real failure (exit ≥ 2, or any diagnostic text) is untouched.
