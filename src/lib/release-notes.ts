/**
 * dextra publishes every release in two languages inside one markdown body: the
 * English notes, a thematic break on its own line, then the Chinese
 * translation. Rendering the whole document means half of it is always a
 * translation the reader can't use — and in the status-bar popover, which shows
 * the notes in a 320px column, that half is what they have to scroll past to
 * reach the buttons. So the UI keeps the half that matches the interface
 * language.
 *
 * The boundary is the long rule the publishing format puts between the halves,
 * and nothing subtler. Guessing it instead — from where the Chinese starts, or
 * from which sections look alike — cannot be made safe: a section written in
 * Chinese at the end of otherwise English notes puts all the Han on one side of
 * a rule exactly like a translation does, and it can carry the same heading, the
 * same shape, even the same version number. Every such guess has a document that
 * defeats it, and defeating it truncates the notes for both readers, which is
 * worse than showing both languages. The rule is instead something the author
 * types on purpose, so it is read as what it is: a marker.
 *
 * What counts as one is a rule far longer than the `---` anyone writes to divide
 * a section — see {@link LANGUAGE_SEPARATOR}. Notes that don't carry one, or
 * whose halves don't actually read in different languages, render whole, as they
 * did before this existed.

 * marker from ordinary punctuation — a `---` dividing two English sections is
 * not a language boundary, and treating it as one hides everything below it.
 * Twelve sits clear of both: well past anything typed to break up a paragraph,
 * well short of the published separator.
