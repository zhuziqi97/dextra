/**
 * AIR async-task projection helpers.
 *
 * The wire (`async_task` events / the snapshot's `async_tasks` table) carries
 * PARTIAL deltas keyed by task id — see `AsyncTaskDelta` in `lib/types`. These
 * helpers implement the client half, shared by the connections reducer (live
 * events + snapshot hydrate) so it matches the backend's
 * `SessionState::apply_event`:
 *
 * - only a `spawned` delta may CREATE a row. A delta naming an unknown task
 *   means its announcement — the one frame carrying name, type and stop
 *   affordance — was missed, and a placeholder row is worse than none.
 * - every other field is optional and ABSENT MEANS UNCHANGED. A progress tick
 *   carries only what moved, so treating absence as "clear it" would blank a
 *   task's name on its first update.
 *
 * Rows are RETAINED after they settle rather than dropped on the terminal
 * state, because the adapter keeps revising a finished task: it attaches a late
 * `outputFilePath`, and corrects a best-effort `stopped` (inferred from its
 * liveness level) into the real `completed`/`failed` when the authoritative
 * edge arrives. An evicted row would be re-created by its own correction — and
 * since `spawned` is what carries identity, it would come back nameless.
 * Presentation decides what to SHOW (see `liveAsyncTasks`); this table decides
 * what is true. Kept dependency-free for unit testing without the context
 * harness.
