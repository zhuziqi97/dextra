/**
 * Which session an OS notification is about, in words a user recognises.
 *
 * A notification used to be titled with the window's ACTIVE folder — not the
 * folder of the session that raised it — and to name only the agent, so with
 * several sessions running an "<agent> needs permission" notification pointed
 * at none of them in particular, and could name the wrong folder outright.
 *
 * The connection's context key is its tab id. From the tab we reach the
 * persisted conversation (its title, its own folder), falling back to the
 * tab's label for a draft that has no row yet.
 *
 * A key no tab owns is reached through the conversation its connection serves
 * instead. That is not only a canvas card: closing a tab whose agent is still
 * busy keeps its connection (see `shouldDisconnectOnUnmount`), so the turn
 * that finishes in the background — exactly when a notification is the only
 * way to learn of it — arrives under a tab id that no longer exists. A
 * connection with no known conversation (a delegated sub-agent's own
 * connection) keeps the old active-folder title.
