/**
 * What an ACP `error` event is, keyed on its stable `code` — which decides
 * what it leaves behind besides its notification.
 *
 * The backend raises one `error` event for very different things: a turn that
 * failed, an agent process that died, a mode switch the agent refused, an image
 * Grok dropped. Every one the user should hear about is a notification (a toast,
 * recorded in the status-bar alert list — see `lib/notify`); none is a strip
 * under the composer, which is kept for what is still in progress. They differ
 * in what else happens:
 *
 * - `session` — this session's state went wrong (the turn, the connection, the
 *   restore). It also becomes the session's current error (`conn.error`, read
 *   by the connection-status popover) until the next prompt, and an
 *   `error`-level one raises an OS notification for a user who is away.
 * - `action` — the answer to something the user just did (switch mode, pick a
 *   model or option, pause a goal, attach an image). The notification is all:
 *   no session state, no OS notification — the user is looking already.
 * - `transcript` — already shown by a card in the transcript; nothing at all.
 *   The backend still raises the `error` for readers that only see the event
 *   stream (chat-channel bridges, the pet), not for the app.
 *
 * Unknown and absent codes take the conservative default, a `session` error, so
 * a failure the table does not know about is never demoted.
