/**
 * An agent session's warning or error: shown once, and kept.
 *
 * The toast is the notification — it takes the user's attention and leaves on
 * its own. The status-bar alert list is its record, so a toast that left before
 * it was read can be read again there. A notified message is never also drawn
 * as a strip under the composer: that dock is kept for what is still in
 * progress (a retry, a reconnect), which updates in place and clears itself.
 *
 * `key` names the MESSAGE, not the call. Telling the same thing again — a
 * notice the agent repeats, the typed account of a failure dextra already
 * reported — updates the toast on screen and replaces the list entry instead
 * of stacking copies.
 *
 * Info-level messages are toast-only: the list is for things that went wrong
 * or need attention ("Alerts"), and an FYI has nothing to come back to.
