/**
 * Plugins an agent could not load (`plugin_load_failures` events).
 *
 * Claude Code 2.1.283+ lists them on every `system/init` frame as
 * `plugin_errors`, and claude-agent-acp only writes them to its own stderr —
 * they have no ACP surface. The backend reads them off the raw SDK stream dextra
 * already subscribes to and forwards a set once per connection (again only when
 * it changes), so a plugin that silently lost its commands, skills, agents or
 * MCP servers says so. It matters beyond convenience: a plugin hook that fails
 * to load can be the one guarding the permissions that plugin declares.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free so the presentation rules are unit-testable without the
 * connections provider.
