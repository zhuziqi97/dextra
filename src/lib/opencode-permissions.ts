/**
 * Pure model for OpenCode's `permission` config block.
 *
 * Shape comes from the official schema (`https://opencode.ai/config.json`,
 * `$defs/PermissionConfig`), semantics from the docs
 * (https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/):
 *
 *   "permission": "allow"                     // one action for everything
 *   "permission": { "*": "ask", "bash": "allow" }
 *   "permission": { "bash": { "*": "ask", "git *": "allow" } }
 *
 * An action is `allow` (run without approval) / `ask` (prompt) / `deny`
 * (block).
 *
 * ## Why key order is load-bearing
 *
 * OpenCode flattens the whole block into ONE list of rules and resolves a call
 * with `findLast` (`packages/opencode/src/permission/index.ts`):
 *
 *     for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(permission)) {
 *       if (typeof value === "string") { ruleset.push({permission: key, action: value, pattern: "*"}) ... }
 *       ruleset.push(...Object.entries(value).map(([pattern, action]) => ({permission: key, pattern, action})))
 *     }
 *     rulesets.flat().findLast((rule) =>
 *       Wildcard.match(permission, rule.permission) && Wildcard.match(pattern, rule.pattern))
 *
 * The tool name is matched with the same wildcard matcher as the pattern, so a
 * top-level `"*"` matches EVERY tool — and because the last match wins, a `"*"`
 * written after `"bash"` silently overrides it. `{"bash":"deny","*":"allow"}`
 * allows bash. Every writer here therefore re-emits `"*"` first, in its scope,
 * and {@link readOpenCodePermissions} reports `orderingUnsafe` for a document
 * that arrived the other way round so the UI never shows a rule that is not the
 * one actually in force.
 *
 * `"*"` inside a scope is that scope's base action: at the top level it is the
 * global default, inside a key it is the key's default before its patterns.
 * This module treats "base action" and `"*"` as the same thing so the UI has a
 * single mental model.
 *
 * ## Agents
 *
 * Per-agent blocks (`agent.<name>.permission`) are appended AFTER the global
 * rules, so they win the same `findLast`. Anything claiming "nothing will
 * prompt" has to account for them — see {@link applyOpenCodeAutoAccept}.
 *
 * Every function is pure: it parses the given JSON text, mutates a clone and
 * returns new JSON text, leaving all unrelated keys untouched. Invalid JSON is
 * returned unchanged — the caller's raw-JSON editor owns that error.

 * A containment question, not a text match. Asking whether `b` matches `a`'s
 * literal *text* is only exact when `a` has no metacharacters of its own:
 * `"git ?"` and `"git *"` each match the other's text, yet only `"git *"`
 * covers the other's language. Both halves of an OpenCode rule — the tool name
 * and the pattern — are globs, so both need the real answer. A token-by-token
 * walk is not enough either, because two `*`s can trade responsibility for the
 * same characters: `"*?"` covers `"a*"`, and no left-to-right pairing sees it.
 *
 * So: run `b` as an NFA determinized on the fly while `a` generates. State is
 * `a`'s position plus the set of `b` positions still live. `a`'s literals emit
 * themselves; its `?` and `*` emit every representative character — each
 * literal appearing anywhere in `b`, plus one that appears nowhere, which
 * stands for all the rest. Wherever `a` can stop, `b` must be able to accept;
 * the first place it cannot is a string in `a` but not in `b`. Both patterns
 * are expanded through {@link globVariants} first, so the trailing-`" *"` rule
 * is honoured on both sides — the side that bites is `a`: `" *"` matches the
 * empty string and `"?*"` does not.
 *
 * The live set is a sorted array rather than a bitmask so that pattern length
 * is not capped at a machine word: `"packages/web/src/content/docs/*.mdx"`
 * alone needs 36 states, and giving up on it would quietly switch the check off
 * for exactly the patterns the docs use as examples. Everything is indexed by
 * UTF-16 code unit, the alphabet the matcher's own regex works in.
 *
 * Exact for this dialect. Checked against the real matcher over every pair of
 * globs up to length 4 on a 3-letter alphabet, deciding containment by direct
 * comparison of the strings up to length 6 each one matches: 609,961 pairs, no
 * disagreement in either direction. Case-sensitive, deliberately: OpenCode
 * folds case only on Windows, and this runs in a webview that need not be on
 * the agent's machine, so it stays quiet rather than warn wrongly.
