//! Wire types for the token-usage dashboard.
//!
//! ## What "usage" means here
//!
//! One row of [`crate::db::entities::token_usage_turn`] is one *API call's*
//! usage as the agent's own transcript reported it. Summing them is the same
//! semantic `parsers::compute_session_stats` already uses for a single
//! conversation's total — input tokens legitimately repeat across turns
//! because every call re-sends the conversation prefix, and that repetition is
//! exactly what a spend dashboard is measuring.
//!
//! One nuance worth stating: for Codex, `SessionStats::total_usage` shown in
//! the conversation panel is the agent's own authoritative cumulative counter,
//! not the sum of turns. The dashboard always sums turns (it has to — a
//! session-level total cannot be placed on a time axis), so a Codex
//! conversation's dashboard total can differ slightly from the number its
//! detail panel prints.
//!
//! ## Time
//!
//! Facts are stored in UTC. Every bucket boundary (day / week / month / hour of
//! day / weekday) is computed in the *viewer's* local time, using the
//! `tz_offset_minutes` the client sends. A fixed offset is used for the whole
//! range rather than a real tz database: a DST transition inside the range
//! shifts one boundary by an hour, which is immaterial at this granularity and
//! keeps the aggregation a pure, testable function.
