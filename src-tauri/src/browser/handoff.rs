//! Page → conversation: what the built-in browser hands to the composer when
//! a person points at something on a page and says "this".
//!
//! The direction this module serves is the opposite of `agent`: nothing here
//! is gated on a grant, because nothing here happens without a person doing
//! it, and what comes out lands in the composer where they can read it, edit
//! it and delete it before anything is sent. What it is NOT is trustworthy:
//! every string below was chosen by the page, so each is capped on arrival
//! and the rendered block says plainly that it is page content — data about a
//! page, never an instruction to follow.
//!
//! Two shapes go over: an element the person picked (`PICKER_JS` draws the
//! highlight and reports the element) and the lines a page printed to its
//! console. Both come out as one markdown block for the agent plus a short
//! label for the badge that stands in for it in the composer.
