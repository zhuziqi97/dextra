//! The `dextra-doc:` document guest: a local HTML file shown through a webview
//! of its own, whose every request the host answers from the file's folder.
//! This is what the desktop shows for an `.html` file instead of an inline
//! `srcdoc` preview: a real document with a real URL, so routing, `fetch` of
//! sibling files and relative links work — inside a fence.
//!
//! The fence, in order of importance:
//!
//! - **Only guests have the scheme.** The handler is registered on the guest
//!   webview's own builder, so the app's webview and ordinary browser tabs
//!   cannot address `dextra-doc:` at all; and the handler is bound to one
//!   grant (root + entry) and checks the webview id it is called for.
//! - **Only files under the root.** Same rule as the inline preview: the root
//!   is the workspace folder the file sits in (else its own directory), the
//!   path is canonicalized and confined, and the file is then opened
//!   component by component without following any symlink (a directory
//!   swapped for a symlink after the check is refused, not followed). No
//!   directory listings.
//! - **Safe mode by default.** The document is served with a CSP that runs
//!   no script and opens no connection; images, styles and fonts come from
//!   the root only. **Dynamic mode** is a per-file, per-session decision by
//!   the user: scripts run, but still only from the root, and the only
//!   endpoint they can reach is the root (`connect-src 'self'`).
//! - **What was approved is what runs.** Dynamic mode records when it was
//!   granted; a file whose timestamps (its own, or the symlink's it was
//!   requested through) are newer than that, or whose content differs from
//!   what was served under the same path since, drops the guest back to safe
//!   mode and is not served — and every guest showing the document reloads
//!   under the safe policy. The document the user approved cannot be swapped
//!   underneath the approval.
//! - **A guest goes nowhere else.** Top-level navigation to a web address is
//!   refused and reported so the user can open it in a browser tab;
//!   `window.open` and downloads are refused; nothing a guest stores
//!   outlives the run.
//! - **One document, one origin.** Every grant mints a host of its own, so
//!   two documents are two origins and the engine keeps what they store
//!   apart. The data store alone does not do this: macOS hands each guest a
//!   non-persistent `WKWebsiteDataStore`, but on Windows every in-private
//!   webview of the process shares one partition, and a shared partition
//!   under a shared origin is one `localStorage` for every document the user
//!   opens.
//!
//! A grant lives for the session: switching files and coming back keeps the
//! mode the user chose (and the approval time it was chosen at).
