/// Retiring the watcher here instead would be wrong whenever the download's
/// callback arrives late: by then the tab may be loading something else, and
/// clearing that navigation's state would both stop its spinner early and
/// swallow its real failure.
///
/// Known limit: the engine does not say which navigation a download came
/// from, and for a redirected download the reported URL is the FINAL one
/// (verified on macOS: navigating to a URL that 302s to a file reports the
/// file's URL), so the address cannot be used to correlate either. A download
/// callback that arrives after a later navigation has started therefore marks
/// that navigation's generation, and if it then fails its error is not
/// reported. The alternative — matching on the URL — would put an error page
/// over a perfectly good page for every redirected download, which is the
/// common case.
///
/// A surface that cannot answer a load state has no watcher — the one it was
/// given exits at its first tick — so nothing there would ever consume the
/// mark: those tabs settle here and now, or they would spin for ever. That is
/// the owned window on macOS and Windows, where the host has no hold on the
/// engine webview, and NOT the owned window on Linux, which answers like an
/// embedded tab; asking the surface keeps the two apart without naming either.
