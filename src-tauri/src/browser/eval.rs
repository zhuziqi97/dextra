//! Running an agent's own code on a page — the most powerful thing on this
//! surface, and the one with a switch of its very own.
//!
//! Everything else an agent may do to a page is a *named* act: read the tree,
//! click the ref the tree handed out, type this text, take a picture. A person
//! sharing a tab at `control` can picture the whole set. Arbitrary code is not
//! a member of that set — it is the set — so it is gated twice more on top of
//! the share: a switch of its own, which ships OFF, and the `control` level.
//! Both are read from the registry here, and an agent cannot reach either.
//!
//! A per-snippet confirmation is available on top of those and is not on by
//! default (`evalApproval` in the frontend's `browser-prefs`). That is a
//! deliberate placement of the decision rather than an absence of one: the
//! question used to be asked once per snippet and never remembered, which is
//! the most repetitive consent in the app, and a dialog answered by reflex is
//! not consent. So the weight sits on the switch, whose own text says that
//! turning it on means code runs without asking — a question asked once, while
//! the person is deciding, instead of a hundred times while they are working.
//! Either way the run is recorded on that tab's activity strip: not asking is
//! not the same as not showing.
//!
//! Two decisions here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong later.
//!
//! **The code runs in the page's own world, not dextra's.** The tempting thing
//! is to reuse the isolated world the rest of this subsystem evaluates in — it
//! has a proven envelope and the page cannot see it. It is also where
//! `browser_snapshot`, `browser_screenshot` and the action tools build their
//! answers, out of that world's `JSON.stringify` and that world's prototypes.
//! One confirmed snippet could replace those, and from then on every later
//! tool call's answer is whatever the snippet wants it to be — including the
//! `url` the host holds against the grant, which is how a page nobody shared
//! would be read. A person who allows one snippet has not allowed that. The
//! page's world has exactly the reach they did allow, and is walled off from
//! ours by the engine.
//!
//! **The answer carries no address.** The code is inlined into the source text
//! the engine parses — it has to be, because `eval` and `new Function` are
//! what a page's CSP switches off, and this must work on a page with a strict
//! one. Inlined text can close the wrapper around it and return anything at
//! all, so nothing in [`EvalAnswer`] can be trusted for a decision. Where the
//! page *is* comes from a separate evaluation in dextra's own world, which no
//! agent text ever enters; see `commands::browser::agent_eval_core`.
