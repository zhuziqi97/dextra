//! The empty tab's page: `about:blank`, painted in the app's own colours.
//!
//! The engine's blank document is white in every theme, and it is the one
//! surface in the app that cannot be styled from the app's stylesheet — a
//! native webview paints itself. That white is also what the engine HOLDS on
//! the way to a page (nothing else is painted until the new document does),
//! so in a dark theme it is both what an empty tab shows for as long as it is
//! empty and what flashes on the way to the first page in it.
//!
//! So the host paints it. The frontend owns the colour — it is a variable of
//! the running theme, which the person can change at any time — and pushes it
//! here at startup and on every change (`browser_set_blank_page_theme`); each
//! blank document a tab commits is painted with what was last pushed, and a
//! change repaints the ones already open.
//!
//! Only a tab's OWN blank page:
//! - a popup adopted from `window.open` sits on `about:blank` too, and its
//!   OPENER writes the document into it. The root's background is what fills
//!   the viewport, so painting one there would put our colour behind somebody
//!   else's page — and a white receipt written into a dark-themed popup would
//!   come out with a dark margin around it.
//! - a document guest (`dextra-doc:`) shows a file, never the blank page.
