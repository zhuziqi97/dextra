//! Finding the address of a local server in terminal output.
//!
//! A dev server announces itself by printing a line — `Local: http://localhost:5173/`,
//! `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`, `Now listening on: http://localhost:5000`.
//! That line is the only thing dextra has that says "something is serving now",
//! so it is what the auto-open feature watches. This is the `output` half of
//! what VS Code calls `remote.autoForwardPortsSource`; the `process` half
//! (enumerating listening sockets) is not built — see `services.rs` for why
//! a TCP probe stands in for it.
//!
//! Everything here is pure text work with no I/O, so the whole table of real
//! framework banners is a unit test. The rules:
//!
//! * **Loopback only.** `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127/8`, `::1`, and the
//!   unspecified addresses `0.0.0.0` / `::` (rewritten to `localhost`, which
//!   is what a browser has to connect to). A LAN address — the `Network:` line
//!   every dev server also prints — belongs to a machine, not to a socket this
//!   host can vouch for, and a public address printed by any command at all
//!   would be an open invitation to make the host load it.
//! * **Whole lines only.** The tail of a chunk is carried to the next feed
//!   rather than scanned: half of `http://localhost:5173` is
//!   `http://localhost:51`, a perfectly parseable address for a port nobody
//!   asked about.
//! * **The query survives.** Jupyter prints `http://localhost:8888/?token=…`
//!   and the page is useless without it. Only the fragment is dropped.
