//! Remote egress: how the browser tabs of a remote-workspace window reach the
//! remote host.
//!
//! A remote-workspace window shows a workspace that lives on another machine,
//! and the addresses its agents print (`localhost:3000`) are that machine's.
//! The page still renders here, in a webview of this computer — only its
//! network leaves from there. Each remote connection gets a browser profile
//! of its own whose proxy is a SOCKS5 listener on this computer's loopback;
//! every connection that profile makes is carried as one stream over a single
//! WebSocket to the remote dextra-server's tunnel (`web/browser_tunnel`), which
//! connects to the destination from its side. Nothing is rewritten on the
//! way: the tunnel moves bytes, so TLS, WebSockets and HTTP/2 are exactly what
//! they would be on the remote host.
//!
//! **The listener has no authentication.** Chromium (WebView2) does not do
//! SOCKS5 authentication at all, and tauri's proxy setting drops credentials
//! on Linux — a token could only ever protect the macOS side. It binds to
//! `127.0.0.1` on a port chosen at random, which keeps it off the network;
//! another account on this same computer could still use it to reach the
//! remote host's network, the same as any loopback port forward. Everything
//! it carries goes through the remote server's own token check.
//!
//! **The port never changes for a connection while the app runs**: WebView2
//! fixes a profile's proxy arguments for the life of the process, so a
//! listener that moved would leave that profile's tabs pointing at nothing.
//!
//! **The probe.** Whether an engine really sends a given address through its
//! proxy is not something every engine documents (WebKit sends `localhost`
//! straight to this machine whatever the proxy says). So before a profile's
//! first tab, a hidden page of that profile opens an address on this
//! listener's own port. Through the proxy, that arrives here as a SOCKS
//! request for this very port, and is answered locally; around the proxy, it
//! arrives as a plain HTTP request, which gives the bypass away at once.
