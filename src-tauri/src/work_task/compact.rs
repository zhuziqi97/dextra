//! Pre-prompt context compaction for task runs.
//!
//! A task that goes through several rounds (retry, follow-up, merge) keeps
//! resuming the SAME agent session, so its context window only ever grows. Past
//! a certain occupancy the next round either truncates silently or fails
//! outright — which is why the folder's task settings can name a threshold
//! (`auto_compact_percent`): at or above it, a resumed launch sends the agent's
//! compact command and waits for that turn to land before sending the round's
//! own message.
//!
//! This module is the decision half — which command, and does the reading clear
//! the bar. The turn itself is driven by `engine::TaskEngine::compact_context`.
