//! GitLab REST v4 for the workbench and the delivery path.
//!
//! GitLab is not "GitHub with different words" in the four places that matter
//! here, and each of them is a silent-wrong-answer if you assume otherwise:
//!
//! 1. **Issues and merge requests are separate collections.** GitHub serves
//!    both from `/issues` and splits on a `pull_request` key; here each tab is
//!    its own endpoint, and so is each comment target (`/issues/{iid}/notes`
//!    vs `/merge_requests/{iid}/notes`).
//! 2. **The project is a path, not `{owner}/{repo}`.** Subgroups nest
//!    arbitrarily deep, and the whole path goes into ONE percent-encoded path
//!    segment (`group%2Fsub%2Fproj`).
//! 3. **`merged` is a state, not a flag.** `state=closed` excludes merged
//!    merge requests, so the workbench's "closed" tab asks for everything and
//!    filters locally — otherwise a merged merge request would simply vanish
//!    from a list where GitHub shows it.
//! 4. **Numbers are `iid`, not `id`.** `id` is globally unique and appears in
//!    no URL a human ever sees; addressing by it silently reads another
//!    project's work item.
//!
//! Pagination is offset-based (`page` + `per_page`), and the totals are the
//! one place it differs from the GitHub client: `X-Total` / `X-Total-Pages`
//! are OPTIONAL — GitLab omits them past 10,000 rows on purpose — so
//! `X-Next-Page` is the only signal always present. Rate-limit classification
//! is shared with the GitHub client.
