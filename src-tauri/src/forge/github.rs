//! GitHub REST reads for the workbench. Four hard-won rules are load-bearing
//! here (see `.docs/architecture/2026-08-17-Orca-GitHub-GitLab集成分析.md`):
//!
//! 1. The list comes from `/search/issues`, NOT `/repos/{o}/{r}/issues`. This
//!    is what github.com's own issue list is backed by, and the reason is
//!    pagination: `/issues` serves issues and pull requests from one feed with
//!    no way to ask for one kind, so splitting them client-side made every
//!    page sparse ("API page 3" was not "Issues page 3") and no total existed.
//!    `is:issue` / `is:pr` filters server-side and `total_count` comes back,
//!    which is what makes real page numbers possible.
//! 2. `/pulls` is still never an option for the PR tab: it silently ignores
//!    `assignee`/`labels` filters (HTTP 200, unfiltered rows).
//! 3. Search costs more than it looks: a SEPARATE 30-requests-per-minute quota
//!    (core is 5000/hour), and only the first [`SEARCH_RESULT_CAP`] results are
//!    reachable — the same ceiling github.com shows. `incomplete_results` means
//!    the query timed out and the page is partial; it is surfaced, not hidden.
//! 4. `assignee=@me` is a 422 on `/issues`; the literal login is resolved via
//!    `GET /user` (cached per api_base+account) and reused for the `assignee:`
//!    qualifier here.
//!
//! One limit is deliberately NOT worked around: `q` may not exceed 256
//! characters. Ten long label names plus a full-length text filter can pass it,
//! and GitHub answers 422 with a message that says exactly that — which is
//! surfaced. Silently dropping the last few qualifiers would instead show a
//! list that quietly ignores part of what the user asked for.
