//! Per-turn wall-clock observations recorded by dextra's own ACP connection
//! layer, for agents whose native session store carries **no per-turn
//! timestamps**.
//!
//! Cursor's ACP `store.db` is the motivating case (verified exhaustively on
//! real sessions): messages carry no timestamps at all, the root record's
//! only epoch field (`f26`) is a one-shot stamp set mid-first-turn (title
//! generation) that never updates, and the CLI store's `turn_timings` (root
//! `f14`) is absent from ACP sessions. Tool calls carry start/end stamps
//! (`f59`/`f60`), so tool-ful turns get a synthesized clock — but a
//! thinking+text-only turn is natively clockless, and its message footer
//! rendered nothing.
//!
//! Every ACP session of such an agent runs THROUGH dextra, so the connection
//! layer is a first-party witness of each turn's real span: it stamps the
//! prompt send and observes the turn's completion. This module persists that
//! observation as one JSONL line per completed turn, keyed by the agent's own
//! session id, and the history parser merges it back for turns whose native
//! store yields no clock. The data is honest — dextra's own measurement, not a
//! fabrication from unrelated fields.
//!
//! ## File layout
//!
//! `<paths::dextra_turn_timings_root()>/<agent>/<session-id>.jsonl`, one JSON
//! object per line:
//!
//! ```jsonc
//! {"v":1,"ord":3,"conn":"<connection uuid>","prompt_sha":"<16 hex chars>",
//!  "started_at_ms":...,"ended_at_ms":...}
//! ```
//!
//! `prompt_sha` is the first 8 bytes (16 hex chars) of the SHA-256 of the
//! prompt's concatenated text blocks — enough to correlate, and it avoids
//! persisting prompt text outside the agent's own store. `(conn, ord)` is
//! the structural position anchor: `ord` counts EVERY prompt turn of the
//! recording connection (journaled or not), and ordinals are comparable only
//! within one `conn`.
//!
//! ## Matching (reader side)
//!
//! Alignment is defense-in-depth; every layer degrades to "no clock", never
//! a wrong clock (each closes a concrete Codex-review counterexample):
//!
//! 1. **Line validity** — schema version, non-inverted span, `ord ≥ 1`,
//!    non-empty `conn`; invalid lines are skipped.
//! 2. **Whole-file order gate** — any `started_at_ms` regression rejects the
//!    ENTIRE journal (a landing-order anomaly means positions can't be
//!    trusted; keeping a prefix would leave a stale pseudo-tail).
//! 3. **Trailing `(conn, ord)`-contiguity trim** — only the journal's tail
//!    run of same-connection, strictly consecutive ordinals is trusted; a
//!    hole (dropped line, skipped non-`end_turn` turn) or a connection
//!    boundary ends trust, so the walk can never slide across a gap onto an
//!    older same-hash entry.
//! 4. **Count guard** — a trusted run longer than the store's user-turn
//!    count means phantom lines; reject everything.
//! 5. **Tail-anchored hash walk** — last user turn ↔ last trusted line,
//!    stepping backwards while `prompt_hash(user text)` matches, stopping at
//!    the first mismatch.
//! 6. **Same-hash run-length equality guard** — identical-prompt runs must
//!    have EQUAL length on both sides or nothing in the run is assigned.
//!
//! Accepted residuals (Codex-reviewed; closing either would need a
//! store-side persistence/tail anchor, which Cursor does not expose):
//!
//! * A turn that reported a clean `end_turn` but was never actually
//!   persisted by Cursor shifts alignment within a trusted run;
//!   misassignment additionally requires an identical repeated prompt at
//!   exactly the shifted offset.
//! * A missing journal SUFFIX — the session's newest turns all lost their
//!   lines (canceled/empty turns are deliberately unjournaled; queue-full
//!   drops) — leaves an older line as the journal tail. If the store's
//!   newest turn hash-collides with that stale tail (and the same-hash run
//!   lengths happen to align), the old span is attributed to the newer turn.
//!   Pinned by `parsers::cursor` test
//!   `accepted_residual_missing_tail_lines_can_misattribute_span`.
//!
//! Sessions never run through this dextra install (copied from another
//! machine) simply have no journal file.
//!
//! ## Growth
//!
//! ~100 bytes per completed turn, one file per session. There is no GC —
//! the footprint is negligible next to the agent's own session store (a
//! single Cursor `store.db`-wal outweighs thousands of journal lines), and
//! deleting a journal would silently strip history clocks.
