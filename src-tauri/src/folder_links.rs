//! Process-global registry of user-authorized workspace links.
//!
//! A workspace folder can have other directories symlinked in as subdirectories
//! (see `commands::folder_links`). Every file operation in the workspace is
//! confined by canonicalizing the target and requiring it to stay under the
//! canonical root — deliberately, so a cloned repo shipping
//! `secrets -> ~/.ssh` can't be read through the HTML preview's sub-resource
//! inlining. Following the *user's own* links therefore needs an explicit
//! allowlist, and that allowlist is this registry.
//!
//! Hydrated from `folder_link` rows at startup (mirroring
//! `custom_agent_service::hydrate_registry`) and kept in sync as links are
//! created / renamed / removed. Empty by default, so an install that never
//! links a folder behaves exactly as before.
//!
//! Paths are stored verbatim and canonicalized at check time rather than at
//! registration time: a target on a slow/absent mount that fails to resolve
//! during startup still works once it's back, and a target replaced on disk
//! never keeps its old authorization.
