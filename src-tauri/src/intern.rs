//! Process-lifetime string interning for **runtime-defined agent metadata**.
//!
//! `AgentType` is `Copy` and threaded by value through ~900 call sites, and
//! [`crate::acp::registry::AcpAgentMeta`] / [`crate::acp::registry::AgentDistribution`]
//! are built entirely from `&'static str` because every agent used to be a
//! compile-time constant. Custom ACP agents break that assumption: their id,
//! name, package spec and download URLs come from the database at runtime.
//!
//! Rather than widen `AgentType` to an owned `String` (which would cost `Copy`
//! and cascade through the whole crate) or convert every registry field to
//! `Cow<'static, str>` (57 destructuring sites across 5 files), we promote the
//! handful of runtime strings to `&'static` by leaking them ONCE and reusing
//! the leak forever.
//!
//! ## Why leaking is bounded here
//!
//! [`intern`] deduplicates: a given string is leaked at most once per process,
//! no matter how many times it is interned. The live set is therefore bounded
//! by the number of DISTINCT strings a user's custom-agent definitions have
//! ever contained during one run of the app — single digits in practice, and
//! it only grows when the user edits a definition. Callers that build whole
//! metadata structs additionally fingerprint them (see
//! `crate::acp::custom_registry`) so re-hydrating an unchanged registry leaks
//! nothing at all.
//!
//! This module is deliberately narrow: do NOT intern user prompts, file
//! contents, session ids, or anything else whose cardinality grows with usage.
