//! The background half of config sync: a timer that uploads when — and only
//! when — the local configuration actually changed.
//!
//! ## Why a periodic hash compare instead of marking dirty on write
//!
//! The obvious design is to flag "config changed" at each write site and
//! debounce. That works when writes funnel through a handful of save
//! functions; dextra's configuration writes are spread across `model_provider`,
//! `custom_agents`, `quick_messages`, `work_task`, and a dozen settings
//! commands, so instrumenting them is both a wide change and one that every
//! new feature can silently forget to make — and a forgotten write site means
//! a setting that never syncs, which is invisible until a user loses it.
//!
//! Collecting a snapshot is a handful of small queries over tens of KB, so
//! comparing its hash every few minutes costs less than the bookkeeping would,
//! cannot be forgotten by a future feature, and sends zero network traffic
//! when nothing changed.
//!
//! ## Upload only
//!
//! This loop never downloads. Pulling remote configuration is always an
//! explicit user action, because an automatic pull is indistinguishable from
//! "another machine silently overwrote my settings".
