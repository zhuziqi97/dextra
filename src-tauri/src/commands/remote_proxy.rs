//! Remote-workspace IPC proxy.
//!
//! When a desktop window is opened against a remote dextra-server, every API
//! call and WebSocket event for that connection is funnelled through Rust
//! commands defined here. The webview never opens an HTTP/WS connection to
//! the remote host directly — that path is blocked by the Tauri webview's
//! secure-context mixed-content rules whenever the remote URL is plain
//! `http://`. Routing through Rust (reqwest + tokio-tungstenite) bypasses
//! those rules and gives us a single place to manage auth, reconnect, and
//! per-window event isolation.
//!
//! ## Isolation contract
//!
//! - Different `connection_id`s use distinct Tauri event channels
//!   (`remote-ws-event-{id}`) AND distinct background WS tasks. Two remote
//!   workspaces opened side-by-side never mix events.
//! - Within one `connection_id`, multiple webviews (main + remote-settings
//!   child window, etc.) share **one** underlying WS connection but each
//!   event is dispatched only to the webview labels that have explicitly
//!   subscribed. We never `app.emit(...)` globally — every emit is
//!   `app.emit_to(EventTarget::webview(label), ...)`.
//! - When the last subscriber for a connection unsubscribes (or its window
//!   is destroyed), the WS task shuts down and the entry is removed from
//!   the proxy state.
//!
//! The whole module is gated to `feature = "tauri-runtime"` via `mod.rs`;
//! the inner-attribute form here would duplicate the predicate.

// proxy the workspace endpoints over reqwest.
//
// Workspace file transfers intentionally have no application-level size
// limit. These bytes move between the user's own machine/browser and their
// workspace; OS disk space, network throughput, and the remote server are
// the natural boundaries.
