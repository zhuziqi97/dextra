/// no path and no body, an Edit names no file.

/// The renames, as the CLI performs them (`coerceInput`, read out of the
/// 2.1.280 binary):
///
/// * `Write` (new in 2.1.280; claude-agent-acp 0.81.1 taught its own titles
///   and diffs the same, #1161): `path` → `file_path`, and `file_text` or
///   `file_content` → `content` — the latter only when exactly one of the two
///   is present, since the CLI will not guess between them.
/// * `Edit` (already accepted by 2.1.274): `path` → `file_path`, `old_str` →
///   `old_string`, `new_str` → `new_string`, and `replace_name` →
///   `replace_all` (true only for `true` / `"true"`).
///
/// Each rename fills a canonical key the input left ABSENT, and only from a

/// sees the arguments the tool ran with. It is display-only and deliberately
/// not gated on a CLI version: a call a CLI refused — one older than the alias,
/// or one still invalid after renaming — renders as the model meant it, next
/// to the error result that says why. `parsers::qoder` reads its Claude-shaped
