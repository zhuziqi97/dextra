/// Where in the history to fork, for the agents that can honour it.

/// Rides as `_meta.jetbrains.air.fork` on `session/fork`. Every adapter that
/// implements it reads the same block and they all fall back to forking at the
/// TAIL when it is absent, so omitting this is always the old behaviour.
///
/// They resolve it differently, which is why all three halves exist:
///
/// * **claude-agent-acp 0.75.1** resolves in three levels: `message_id` against
///   the live id map, then against `messageIdForGrouping` (the API message id,
///   else the record uuid) along the ACTIVE parentUuid chain, then — new in
///   0.75.1 — against the full persisted transcript INCLUDING abandoned
///   branches, where a failed id finally falls through to the fingerprint. Up
///   to 0.74.0 it ignored the fingerprint entirely, so dextra sent the id alone;
///   from 0.75.1 both halves are sent, which is what turns a fork point on an
///   abandoned branch from a silent tail-fork into an exact hit.
///   `crate::parsers::claude` derives the id into
///   [`crate::models::MessageTurn::agent_message_id`], and the hash side is
///   byte-compatible with what `fingerprint_agent_message` computes (a single
///   fingerprint match even wins regardless of occurrence).
/// * **codex-acp 1.8.0** first matches `message_id` against `items[].id`, then
///   falls back to hashing each agent message and taking the
///   `message_occurrence`-th match. Codex rollout files record NO item ids, so
///   dextra cannot produce one it would recognise — the fingerprint is the only
///   path that resolves there, and `message_id` is sent as dextra's own turn id
///   purely because the field is required.
/// * **deepseek-acp 0.8.0** is the only one that can use BOTH halves, so dextra
///   sends both. Its id side accepts either the wire id it stamps on message
///   chunks (`<turn>:<step>`) or the session log's own `message.id`, and
///   `crate::parsers::deepseek` records the latter. Its fingerprint side hashes
///   the history TWICE — once per assistant message, once per whole turn — and
///   refuses (`invalid_params`) when the two land on different turns; dextra
///   renders one bubble per log turn, so the per-turn reading is the one that
///   matches, and the id is what keeps the ambiguous case from ever being
///   reached.
///
/// All three strip a trailing `:segment:<n>` before matching, so ids must not
/// carry one.
