/// then sat at `awaiting_input` because its outstanding-request set kept the
/// orphan keys). Codex issues these concurrently: codex-acp forwards each
/// `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` to its own `session/request_permission`
/// and serializes only its notification queue, not approvals.

/// Grok never forwards a child's chunks or tool calls over ACP (unlike

/// * `subagent_progress` becomes a meta-only `ToolCallUpdate`
///   (`meta.grokSubagentProgress`) so the running Agent card can show a live
///   "N tools · M turns · ctx%" line. Replacing the block's meta is safe for
///   this call: its classification rides `rawInput.subagent_type`, not meta.

///   update — resurrecting a ghost pending card into every later
///   snapshot/attach. An out-of-turn tick is therefore dropped whole (the
///   `subagent_finished` settle below is the out-of-turn-safe channel).
/// * `subagent_finished` for a spawn whose CALL already settled (= a
///   BACKGROUND child; the launch ack was its final wire output) settles via
///   the same `BackgroundActivity` channel Claude's async sub-agents use: the
///   frontend flips the launch card's `[[codeg-background-task]]` marker
