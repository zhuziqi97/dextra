            // what each button grants; its `lifetime` is what
            // `parsePermissionOptionChanges` reads for the duration, since
            // Claude — unlike codex — never states it in the description.
            // 0.65.0 (#958) completes the steering contract the opt-in started:
            // a steered turn's results now only RECORD their outcome and the
            // turn settles at the SDK `idle` spanning both the interrupted and
            // the steered cycle, so the owning prompt stays in flight until the
            // steered work is actually done. That is the fix for #934, which
            // had forced codeg's native push channel off; it is back on for
            // Claude alone via `steering_prompt_required_min_version` (see
            // `manager::submit_feedback` for the two channels). Its other
            // releases carry nothing else for codeg: 0.64.2 reverted #938's
            // ExitPlanMode `plan_update` experiment outright, and 0.65.0's
            // remaining commits are devDependency bumps — the runtime deps and
            // the Node floor still match 0.64.0's.
            // 0.66.0 (#964) introduces the provider-neutral goal extension:
            // initialize advertises `_meta.goal = {version: 1, controlMethod:
            // "_session/goal", actions}` (claude offers ["set", "clear"]) and
            // goal state arrives as `session_info_update._meta.goal` snapshots
            // — {objective, status (active|paused|blocked|limited|complete),
            // iterations?, lastReason?, createdAt/updatedAt (Unix ms),
            // tokenBudget?, tokensUsed?, timeUsedSeconds?, controlMethod},
            // `goal: null` clears. codeg picks the goal channel per connection
            // at initialize (advertised ⇒ neutral only; see the
            // SessionInfoUpdate arm in connection.rs), the same selection that
            // keeps codex goals alive after its silent 1.2.0 switch. #967
            // fixes goal publish/replace reliability.
            // 0.67.0 bumps claude-agent-sdk 0.3.220→0.3.232 and joins the
            // JetBrains AIR extension codex 1.2.0 speaks (#979; record shape
            // finalized in 0.68.0/#992): typed session failures ride
            // `session_info_update._meta.jetbrains.air.sessionFailure` as
            // {id, revision (per-id from 1), category (connection|access|
            // limit|request|service|unknown), severity (warning|error), title,
            // details?, actions (subset of retry|login|new_session)} — upsert

            // `clientCapabilities._meta.jetbrains.air = {version >= 1,
            // capabilities: ["sessionFailure"]}`. codeg advertises it
            // (`build_client_capabilities`) and projects the records into the
            // session-failure banner (`AcpEvent::SessionFailure`); on
            // session/load the adapter re-publishes still-active failures
            // (deliberate; id+revision merging absorbs it). A model fallback
            // (`model_refusal_fallback`)
            // publishes an AIR "advisory" record behind the same gate (#990).
            // Skill tool calls now carry `_meta.claudeCode.skill` plus
            // `skillPath` when a SKILL.md is located (#986) — input for a
            // future dedicated card. Task plans survive across prompts
            // (#974), file-preparing tool calls get a pending title (#978),
            // and the default model option description names the resolved
            // model (#982) — all through existing generic render paths.
            // Compaction remains plain text ("Compacting...") with NO
            // `contextCompaction` meta, so the compaction card stays a
            // codex/grok surface. 0.68.0 (#992) only realigns the failure
            // record (categories narrowed to the six above, actions to the
            // three above). The steering `promptRequired` path is intact
            // across 0.66–0.68 (tarball-verified), so the 0.65.0 floor keeps
            // holding, and `engines.node` stays ">=22".
            // 0.69.0 adds exactly ONE thing (tarball-diffed: the only new
            // string literals in `acp-agent.js` are "collecting",
            // "notReported", "providerError", plus the new
            // `dist/file-change-audit.js`) — the AIR `agentFileChangeReport`
            // capability, shipped in lockstep with codex-acp 1.4.0. It is
            // OFF unless the client asks for it twice, and codeg deliberately
            // asks for neither; see `build_client_capabilities` in
            // connection.rs for the reasoning. The only ambient change is that
            // `airSessionFailureCapabilityMeta` became variadic so the agent
            // can advertise `["sessionFailure", "agentFileChangeReport"]` — an
            // ADDITIVE element in an array codeg only ever membership-tests,
            // so the session-failure gate is unaffected.

            // app-server`; since 1.0.1 it also resolves the resumed
            // `model_provider` from `~/.codex/config.toml` (#224), so codeg no
            // longer injects `MODEL_PROVIDER` to keep resumed sessions on the

            // structured `session_info_update` (`_meta.codex.goal`) rather than
            // live agent text — see `crate::acp::codex_goal`. 1.1.3+ adds three
            // new live signals codeg handles in `connection::emit_conversation_update`:
            // `subAgentActivity` tool calls (#304, suppressed via
            // `is_codex_subagent_activity` — redundant with the collab capsule),
            // retryable turn errors (#289, `_meta.codex.error` → a transient

            // context-compaction lifecycle (#288, `_meta.contextCompaction` tool
            // call → a dedicated frontend card). 1.1.x also adds Plan mode: the
            // `collaboration_mode` config option (rendered by the generic
            // config-option path) and native `request_user_input`, delivered as
            // an ACP `elicitation/create` request — codeg advertises
            // `elicitation.form` for Codex and bridges the WHOLE form surface
            // (Plan-mode questions, MCP-server forms, MCP tool-call approvals)
            // in `handle_elicitation_request` / `question::classify_elicitation`.
            // 1.1.5 (#322) also widened codex-acp's MCP config filtering to
            // project `.codex` layers, which is why codeg forces
            // `DISABLE_MCP_CONFIG_FILTERING` (see `apply_codex_env_policy`) so
            // the injected `codeg-mcp` server always survives. 1.1.6 adds
            // steering (#309): `_session/steering` injects a user prompt into
            // the LIVE turn (initialize advertises `_meta.steering.supported`)
            // — codeg keeps codex on the MCP pull channel because 1.1.9 still
            // lacks the `promptRequired` idle opt-in
            // (`steering_prompt_required_min_version` → None; flipping it on
            // is a one-liner once a release implements the opt-in AND its
            // active `injected` path provably keeps the owning prompt pending
            // — claude's 0.64.0 didn't, see #934 in the fn comment). 1.1.7
            // (#326) emits Plan-mode plan
            // contents as a plain `agent_message_chunk`
            // (`_meta.codex.phase = "final_answer"`, no `<proposed_plan>` tags),
            // which the adapter's tag-splitter simply no-ops on — tagged output
            // from older codex still renders as the proposed-plan card. 1.1.8
            // (#351) gates Plan mode behind a review confirmation: when a plan
            // item completes while `collaboration_mode` is `plan`, codex-acp
            // sends a `session/request_permission` marked
            // `_meta.codex = {kind:"plan_review", planItemId}` whose `toolCall`
            // (`plan-review:<itemId>`, kind `switch_mode`, `rawInput.plan`) was
            // NEVER announced as a `tool_call` — codeg seeds it from the request
            // (see `is_codex_plan_review` / `handle_permission_request`) so the
            // follow-up `tool_call_update` has a card to merge into. On approval
            // codex flips the mode back to default (a mid-turn
            // `config_option_update`) and runs the implementation turn inside
            // the SAME `session/prompt`. 1.1.8 (#342) also hangs a structured
            // `_meta.permission = {version, changes[]}` on each permission
            // option, whose `changes[].description` codeg surfaces in the
            // permission card — the contract claude-agent-acp joined in 0.64.1
            // (#930), so that rendering is no longer codex-only. The
            // `clientCapabilities.plan` path (structured
            // `plan_update`s) does NOT apply: sacp 11.0.0's schema has neither
            // the capability nor the session-update variant, so plans keep
            // arriving as `agent_message_chunk`s. That also makes 1.1.9 (#354,
            // which coalesces streamed plan snapshots to one `plan_update`
            // every 150ms and flushes them at item/turn/permission boundaries)
            // inert here — it only runs behind that capability, and its
            // dependency set is byte-identical to 1.1.8's. 1.1.9 still declares
            // no `engines.node`, so the 20.0.0 floor is retained.
            // 1.2.0 rewires two surfaces UNANNOUNCED in its release notes (the
            // #929/#930 pattern again; both tarball-verified): (a) `/goal`
            // transitions move to the provider-neutral
            // `session_info_update._meta.goal` snapshot the claude adapter
            // speaks since 0.66.0 — the legacy `_meta.codex.goal` key is GONE,
            // so codeg's initialize-pinned channel selection (SessionInfoUpdate
            // arm, connection.rs) is what keeps GoalCard alive from this
            // release on. The neutral snapshot collapses usageLimited/
            // budgetLimited into status "limited", adds paused/blocked,
            // carries createdAt/updatedAt in Unix ms and embeds controlMethod
            // "_session/goal" (actions [set, pause, resume, clear]; the old
            // "_codex/session/goal_control" name is kept as an accepted
            // alias). (b) It joins the JetBrains AIR extension (#383; aligned
            // to the final record shape in 1.3.0/#393, same wire as
            // claude-agent-acp 0.67.0 — see that entry): typed session
            // failures gated STRICTLY on the client advertising
            // `clientCapabilities._meta.jetbrains.air`, which codeg does
            // (`build_client_capabilities`). Advertising REPLACES the legacy
            // surfaces on the wire: `_meta.codex.error` (both willRetry
            // branches), warning/config-warning text chunks and dropped
            // deprecation notices all become AIR records (willRetry ⇒
            // severity "warning", terminal ⇒ "error" that deliberately stays
            // active; recovery is implied by turn progress, never published).
            // `codex_retry_indicator` therefore no longer fires on these
            // connections; severity-"warning" records take over the
            // retry-banner role (see the SessionFailure consumer in
            // connection.rs). #377 also normalizes cwd
            // filters for Windows session listing. 1.3.0 (#396) upgrades the
            // compaction lifecycle to the claude-aligned synthetic tool call
            // (kind "think", title "Compact conversation") whose meta is now
            // the versioned object `{contextCompaction: {version: 1}}` — the
            // `contextCompaction: true` boolean marker from 1.1.3 is gone
            // (the schema reserves trigger/preTokens/postTokens/durationMs/
            // error, but 1.3.0 emits none of them). The frontend predicate
            // (`src/lib/context-compaction.ts`) accepts both shapes: the Grok
            // bridge still synthesizes the boolean. #400 restores native
            // provider state after overrides (matters for BYO-provider model
            // switching). New in the bundle and fine on generic cards:
            // synthetic "Guardian Review" tool calls (kind "think") and
            // fuzzyFileSearch ids. Structured plan_update stays inert — its
            // gate is a TOP-LEVEL `clientCapabilities.plan` field sacp 11.0.0
            // cannot express. 1.3.0 still ships NO steering `promptRequired`
            // opt-in (tarball grep: zero hits ⇒ the arm below stays None) and
            // still declares no `engines.node`, so the 20.0.0 floor is
            // retained.
            // 1.4.0 is the codex half of the same AIR `agentFileChangeReport`
            // release as claude-agent-acp 0.69.0 and carries nothing else
            // (tarball-diffed: the only new string literals are that feature's
            // plus the `thread/fork` app-server method it is built on;
            // `@openai/codex` stays ^0.147.0, so the CLI and its native
            // team-of-agents surface are unchanged). codex implements the
            // audit by forking the thread (`approvalPolicy: "never"`,
            // `sandbox: "read-only"`, `ephemeral: true`) and running an extra
            // turn on the fork; claude uses a Stop hook plus a hidden
            // continuation. Either way it is an extra model round-trip per
            // prompt, and it is gated on a client advertisement codeg does not
            // make — see `build_client_capabilities` in connection.rs.
            // 1.6.0/1.6.2 (no 1.5.0 or 1.6.1 was published) add NO new modules
            // and nothing wire-visible: `@openai/codex` moves to ^0.148.0,
            // `thread/reverted` + `thread/queue/changed` join the adapter's
            // IGNORED-notification list (so they never reach a client), and
            // `misalignmentPolicyViolation` becomes a second codex error name
            // mapping onto the EXISTING `policy_denied` bucket —
            // `SESSION_FAILURE_POLICY` (the codex→AIR category/actions table)
            // is byte-identical to 1.3.0's, so the six-category vocabulary in
            // `AcpEvent::SessionFailure` is unchanged. The rest is logging.
            // 1.7.0 rebuilds the permission layer (`src/permissions/*`) and
            // redefines the three approval presets. Both are wire-visible:
            //
            // (a) Option-level `_meta.permission.changes[]` is GONE. Codex's
            // reason moves from `toolCall.title` (1.4.0's
            // `params.reason ?? "Permissions Request"`) to REQUEST-level
            // `_meta.permission = {version: 1, title, description?}`, with
            // `{version: 1, description}` on individual options (MCP
            // elicitation approvals only). Titles are now four fixed strings
            // ("Run command?" / "Allow network access?" / "Make edits?" /
            // "Grant permissions?") and the action itself is described through
            // standard ACP fields `parse_permission_tool_call` already reads
            // (`rawInput.command/cwd/url/additionalPermissions`, `locations`,
            // `content`). `handle_permission_request` hoists the request meta
            // onto the card so the reason survives; claude-agent-acp 0.69.0
            // still emits `changes[]`, so that parser stays. Codex's option
            // IDs were also renamed (`allow_for_session`,
            // `accept_execpolicy_amendment`, `apply_network_policy_amendment:N`
            // …) — inert here, codeg only echoes back the selected id — and
            // network deny amendments introduce codex's first `reject_always`
            // option kind, which `handle_permission_request` already maps.
            // `_meta.codex = {kind: "plan_review", planItemId}` is unchanged,
            // so `is_codex_plan_review` still fires.
            //
            // (b) `AgentMode`: the `read-only` preset's sandbox became
            // `workspaceWrite` (it was `readOnly`) and the presets are now
            // separated by a new `approvalsReviewer` axis — `read-only` =
            // "Ask for approval" (reviewer `user`), `agent` = "Approve for me"
            // (reviewer `auto_review`, i.e. a model decides which escalations
            // to show), `agent-full-access` unchanged. Each preset also gains
            // `_meta.kind` (`standard` / `auto_review` / `full_access`) on both
            // `SessionMode` and the `mode` config option. There is NO read-only
            // sandbox preset any more, which is why
            // `codex_initial_agent_mode` (commands/acp.rs) can no longer
            // promise to preserve one — see its doc comment.
            //
            // 1.8.0–1.11.0 move the bundled Codex from ^0.152.0 to ^0.153.4.
            // 0.153.4 is the first bundled release in this adapter line that
            // accepts Codex's current nested context-management and multi-agent
            // feature configuration; 0.152.x rejects those tables before
            // `session/new` with "invalid type: map, expected a boolean".
            // The later ACP additions remain capability-scoped: codeg does not
            // advertise session forks, native subagent sessions, AIR async
            // tasks, or recommended-value reports. Auth status is an extension
            // notification and unknown extensions remain inert. AI title
            // updates, MCP OAuth fixes, usage reporting, history pagination,
            // and simplified model labels use surfaces codeg already accepts.
            //
            // NOT adopted: native ACP subagent sessions (the draft subagent
            // RFD). The gate is bilateral — `clientCapabilities.subagents: {}`
            // or AIR `nativeSubagentSessions` — and codeg advertises neither,
            // so the lifecycle stays the legacy `subAgentActivity` tool call
            // whose shape (`_meta.codex.subagent = {threadId, path, activity}`)
            // is byte-identical to 1.4.0's. Opting in is not merely unhelpful,
            // it is undeliverable: `agent-client-protocol-schema` 0.11.7 has no
            // `subagents` field on `ClientCapabilities`, and its `SessionUpdate`
            // is an internally-tagged enum with no catch-all arm, so the
            // `subagent_spawned` / `subagent_state_update` notifications would
            // fail to deserialize — child output would then stream to a child
            // session id codeg never learned about and vanish from the
            // timeline. Revisit only after the schema crate ships both.
            // Likewise still not adopted: `agentFileChangeReport` (unchanged

            // mounts the upstream skills chain (`skill_storage_spec` mirrors
            // its roots) and, since 0.2.0, offers `--setup` terminal auth for
            // storing the key in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`.
            //
            // 0.4.0 guards chunked tool-call headers whose later fragments

            //
            // 0.6.0 is the first bump that MOVES the handshake, because its
            // `dsh-*` deps went 0.1.0-rc.7 → 0.1.1-rc.2 and it wired up what
            // that unlocked. Four of the five new capabilities cost codeg
            // nothing — they land on paths that already read the agent's own
            // advertisement:
            //

            //   `{sessionId, cwd}` request is exactly what it accepts (it
            //   rejects `additionalDirectories`, which codeg never sends).
            // * `promptCapabilities.image` went from a hardwired `false` to
            //   "true whenever the attachment store is mounted", which the
            //   stock composition always does — so the composer's upload path
            //   un-gates through `effective_prompt_capabilities` with no
            //   per-agent branch. Sending pixels to a text-only model is
            //   refused by the agent with a message naming the model to switch
            //   to, which is a better failure than hiding the button.
            // * Multi-provider deployments re-encode the model config value as
            //   `provider::model` and ship SERVER-SIDE `configOptions` groups.
            //   `deriveModelGroups` already yields to server groups verbatim,
            //   and single-provider installs (i.e. nearly all of them) keep
            //   emitting bare model ids, so the selector is unaffected either
            //   way. codeg does not drive the new `providers/*` UNSTABLE plane;
            //   routes are configured in `settings.yaml`, and the DeepSeek
            //   settings panel still owns `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`/`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
            //   for the built-in `deepseek-official` route.
            // * `session/load` + `session/resume` + `session/fork` now answer
            //   `-32002 Resource not found` (was `-32603`) for a session id with
            //   no log, which `classify_load_failure` already maps to the
            //   `resource_not_found` copy — a stale workspace id stops looking
            //   like an agent crash.
            //
            // The fifth, context compaction, is the one codeg cannot take on
            // the wire: `compaction_update` / `compaction_summary_chunk` are
            // gated behind a `clientCapabilities.session.compaction` that the
            // pinned `agent-client-protocol-schema` (0.11) can neither
            // advertise nor deserialize, so the agent correctly stays silent.
            // Compaction still HAPPENS (auto at the window limit, or `/compact`)
            // and still lands in the log, so `parsers::deepseek` renders it
            // from there — see its `compaction/*` arm.
            //
            // What `parsers::deepseek` did have to learn is the log's two new
            // shapes: `image` content blocks (bytes live in the content-
            // addressed `$DSH_HOME/attachments/v1` store, the log keeps only a
            // `sha256:` ref) and the `compaction/*` lifecycle. The three
            // upstream layouts codeg mirrors — `dsh-home-paths`'
            // `resolveDshHome`, `dsh-skill-filesystem`'s roots,
            // `dsh-session-persistence-jsonl`'s `session.jsonl[.zstd]` tree —
            // are unchanged across rc.7 → rc.2, so nothing else moved.
            //
            // 0.7.0 moves NOTHING on the wire — `protocol/initialize.js`差异
            // 只有 `AGENT_INFO.version` 一行，`@agentclientprotocol/sdk` 和上面
            // 那三个被镜像的 `dsh-*` 依赖都停在原版本，所以上述能力断言与
            // `parsers::deepseek` 都不用动。两处值得知道的行为变化：
            //
            // * `session/load` + `session/fork` 的 cwd 校验从裸字符串相等换成
            //   `sameWorkspace()`（realpath.native，fail-closed）。这是**放宽**：
            //   codeg 送的工作区路径以前只要拼写与日志里记的不同就被拒——macOS
            //   的 `/var` → `/private/var`、Windows 8.3 短名——恢复会莫名失败。
            //   `session/list` 的 cwd 过滤同样改成按目录判定。
            // * Windows 上模型面向的 shell 工具从 `bash` 换成 `pwsh`
            //   (`composition/shell.js` 的 `mountNativeShell`)；非 Windows 仍是
            //   `bash`。`dsh-tool-pwsh` 的 `presentCall` 与 `dsh-tool-bash` 逐字
            //   同形（前台 `card: "terminal"` + `{title, description, cwd?}`，
            //   后台才是 `card: "generic"` + 裸字符串 `rawInput`），所以 codeg
            //   的终端工具卡在两个平台上拿到的形状一致。
            //
            // Keep `version` and `package` moving together: `version` is what
            // the agents list shows as the upgrade target beside the installed
