//! Listener-facing access for the built-in browser's agent tools
//! (`browser_list_tabs` / `browser_snapshot` / `browser_console_messages` /
//! `browser_screenshot`, and the five action tools `browser_click` /
//! `browser_hover` / `browser_type` / `browser_press_key` /
//! `browser_select_option`) carried by dextra-mcp.
//!
//! Nothing here decides whether a page may be read or acted on. That decision
//! is `crate::browser::agent`'s, and it is enforced inside
//! `commands::browser::agent_snapshot_core` / `agent_act_core`, which the
//! production impl calls — so an MCP read passes the same grant check, and
//! leaves the same line on the tab's activity strip, as any other read. A tool
//! surface that reimplemented the check would be a second place to get it
//! wrong, and the first place someone forgot to emit the audit line from.
//!
//! Two things this module does own:
//!
//! * **The shape of the answer.** A refusal is a value, not a transport error:
//!   `browser_grant_required` is something the agent can act on (ask the user
//!   to share the tab), so it comes back as an outcome the companion renders
//!   into readable text rather than as a failed tool call that aborts a turn.
//! * **Where there are no tabs at all.** A browser tab is a native webview
//!   this process owns. In server mode there is no such thing — what the user
//!   sees in a "browser tab" is an iframe their own browser renders, which
//!   this process cannot reach — so [`NoBrowserTabs`] answers there, and the
//!   group is not advertised in the first place.
