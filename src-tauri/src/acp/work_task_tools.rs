//! Listener-facing access for the work-task reporting tools (`task_progress` /
//! `task_complete`) carried by dextra-mcp. The listener resolves the caller's
//! parent connection from its per-launch token and hands the report here; the
//! production impl (`crate::work_task::engine::EngineWorkTaskTools`) maps the
//! connection to the owning task + execution generation and records it. Kept as
//! a trait so the listener stays decoupled from the engine (and tests can stub
//! it). Mirrors [`crate::acp::session_info::SessionInfoAccess`].
