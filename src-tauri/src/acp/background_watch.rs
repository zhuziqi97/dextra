//! Transcript-tail watcher: surfaces Claude Code's OUT-OF-TURN activity.
//!
//! Claude Code produces activity outside any dextra-driven prompt turn:
//! `<task-notification>` completions of async sub-agents (`Agent` launched in
//! the background) and background shell tasks, the agent's continued work
//! after such a notification (which can run for many minutes), and cron//loop
//! autonomous turns. None of that has a reliable ACP wire representation —
//! out-of-turn `session/update`s are forwarded but carry no turn settlement,
//! and cron turns produce NO wire events at all (claude-agent-acp #270). The
//! session's own JSONL transcript is the only complete source, so this module
//! tails it:
//!
//! * **Accounting** — launch acks are detected from the record-level
//!   `toolUseResult` (`status:"async_launched"` → `agentId`, or
//!   `backgroundTaskId` for background shells; these fields exist ONLY on
//!   disk, never on the wire), settled by any of: a `<task-notification>`
//!   record (matching `<task-id>`), a `TaskOutput` result whose structured
//!   `task.status` reached a terminal state, or a `TaskStop`/`KillShell`
//!   call. Background shells almost never emit a `<task-notification>` (they
//!   are collected inline via `TaskOutput` or just left running), so those
//!   two extra signals are what keep the count from stranding. Entries are
//!   re-armed when the main agent resumes a settled sub-agent via
//!   `SendMessage`, and expired past
//!   [`background_keepalive_max_age`]. The outstanding count is mirrored into
//!   `SessionState` (via `apply_event`) to exempt the connection from both
//!   idle sweeps — disconnecting kills the agent CLI, and the background work
//!   dies with it.
//!
//! * **Rendering** — new transcript records that do NOT belong to a
//!   dextra-sent prompt turn are assembled into turns with the SAME Stage-A/
//!   Stage-B code the detail parser uses ([`ClaudeRecordAccumulator`] +
//!   [`group_into_turns`]) and emitted as `AcpEvent::BackgroundActivity`
//!   upserts for the frontend's overlay slice. Foreground turns are excluded
//!   by the **prompt ledger**: every prompt dextra sends is fingerprinted, and
//!   a transcript turn whose initiating user record matches an unconsumed
//!   fingerprint is the wire-rendered foreground turn (each fingerprint is
//!   consumed exactly once, so a cron//loop re-fire of the SAME text later
//!   correctly classifies as out-of-turn).
//!
//! * **Session title** — Claude Code's generated name arrives as a dedicated
//!   `ai-title` transcript record whenever the background summarizer finishes,
//!   routinely AFTER the turn that triggered it ended. The ACP adapter only
//!   pulls the name at turn-end (`maybeUpdateSessionTitle`, claude-agent-acp
//!   0.69.0), so on a short session there is nothing to read yet and no wire
//!   event ever follows. These bytes are already being tailed, so the records
//!   are folded here and handed to [`publish_native_title`] — the same path a
//!   live ACP title takes. Not activity: it rides alongside the activity event
//!   rather than inside it (see `run_watch`).
//!
//! The watcher is connection-scoped on purpose: background work cannot outlive
//! the agent CLI process, whose lifetime IS the connection's. Poll ticks are
//! mtime-gated (an unchanged file costs one `stat`).
