//! Browser-free ("headless") Google sign-in for Antigravity.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! Antigravity's two OAuth methods (`oauth-personal`, `oauth-business`) are the
//! only ones that reach the free tier with a plain Google account, and both
//! authenticate through a loopback browser flow that the **agent process** runs
//! (`oauth/credential_manager.py::_run_redirect_server`): it binds a one-shot
//! HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<random port>`, calls `webbrowser.open(auth_url)`,
//! and blocks for up to 300 seconds waiting for Google to redirect back.
//!
//! On a Linux server with no desktop that is a dead end, and a silent one:
//! `webbrowser.open` finds no browser and returns `False` **without raising**,
//! so the agent's own "could not open a browser" log line never fires. The user
//! creates a session, it hangs for five minutes, and then fails with
//! `Onboarding failed: Timed out waiting for the authentication flow to
//! complete.` Nothing anywhere prints a link they could open themselves.
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! Two facts make a fix possible without a tunnel, a second machine, or a copy
//! of Google's OAuth client secret:
//!
//! 1. **The agent prints the authorization URL.** `_run_redirect_server` ends
//!    with an unconditional `print("Open the following link to authenticate the
//!    ACP server: {url}")`. WHICH pipe it lands on is a version detail and has
//!    already moved once: 1.0.0 printed it to stdout, alongside the JSON-RPC
//!    frames, and 1.1.1 prints it to stderr. So both streams are scanned for
//!    it (see [`AuthUrlSink`]) — a sign-in that reads only one of them silently
//!    waits out [`URL_WAIT`] and reports that the agent produced no link.
//!    `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is set for the stdout case, where CPython
//!    block-buffers a pipe and the line would otherwise sit in that buffer
//!    indefinitely; stderr is unbuffered either way.
//!
//! 2. **The loopback server accepts the redirect from anyone.** It records
//!    whatever single request it receives and hands the query string to
//!    `flow.fetch_token`, which validates `state` and exchanges the code. The
//!    browser that completes the consent does not have to be the process that
//!    delivers the result.
//!
//! So: dextra starts a short-lived agent process purely to sign in, drives ACP
//! `initialize` + `authenticate` over its stdio, scrapes the printed URL, and
//! shows it. The user opens it in whatever browser they have, consents, and
//! lands on a `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?state=…&code=…` page their browser
//! cannot reach. They paste that address back, and dextra — which *is* on the
//! machine where that port is listening — performs the redirect on their
//! behalf. The agent then completes the exchange, runs its own onboarding, and
//! writes the credential exactly where a real session will look for it.
//!
//! # Why a dedicated process, and not the session's connection
//!
//! `authenticate` is a top-level ACP request: it triggers the identical sign-in
//! that `session/new` would, but before any session exists. Driving it from a
//! throwaway child keeps the whole feature inside the settings panel — no new
//! session-path states, no mid-`session/new` UI, and a failed sign-in costs the
//! user a retry rather than a broken conversation. The child is spawned with
//! [`crate::acp::connection::antigravity_launch_env`], i.e. byte-for-byte the
//! environment a real launch uses, because `GEMINI_HOME` decides where the
//! token is written and `AGY_ACP_FORCE_FILE_STORAGE` decides whether it is a
//! file or the macOS keychain. A child with a different environment would sign
//! the user in and then leave the credential somewhere nothing reads.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! `finish` takes a URL typed by the user and makes dextra issue an HTTP request
//! — the shape of an SSRF. It is closed by construction: the request target is
//! rebuilt from the `redirect_uri` **dextra captured from the agent's own
//! authorization URL**, and only `code`/`state`/`error` are taken from the
//! paste. The captured value is additionally required to be
//! `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`, matching the agent's hardcoded `_LOOPBACK_HOST`,
//! so even a compromised upstream cannot redirect dextra off the loopback. The
//! request also bypasses any configured proxy: a loopback address must never
//! leave the machine.
//!
//! # Signing out
//!
//! Signing in is only half an account: once a credential exists the agent
//! refreshes it silently and `authenticate` returns without opening anything,
//! so the sign-in above can never reach a second Google account. [`sign_out`]
//! is the other half, and it drives the agent's own ACP `logout` for the same
//! reason [`start`] drives its `authenticate` — where the credential lives
//! (a macOS login-keychain item, or a file under `GEMINI_HOME`) is decided by
//! rules inside the agent, so deleting it from here would be dextra guessing at
//! someone else's storage layout.
