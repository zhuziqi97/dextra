//! Which of codex's usage reports read the context window.
//!
//! codex reports usage once per model request, and the context ring reads the
//! latest report as the occupancy: `last_token_usage.total_tokens` over
//! `model_context_window` — what codex's own status line counts as the tokens
//! in the context window, and what codex-acp forwards as `usage_update.used`.
//! That holds while a request is one pass over the conversation. A request that
//! runs a hosted web search is not: the provider runs the search loop
//! server-side, inside that one request, and reports usage for the whole loop —
//! the pages it read and, on some providers, a fresh pass over the conversation
//! per search — none of which the conversation keeps (codex records the
//! `web_search_call` items, not what they fetched). Issue #846 has 530 278 of a
//! 996 147-token window reported for such a request (53 %), then 74 215 for the
//! very next one, which re-sent the whole conversation. OpenAI's own models do
//! it too: a gpt-5.5 request that searched 13 times reported 248 708 input
//! tokens between neighbours of 143 695 and 150 661.
//!
//! So that report is set aside and the ring keeps the reading before it —
//! behind by the latest exchange until the next request reports, where the
//! searched report overstates the context by the whole loop. The live path
//! ([`crate::acp::connection`]) and the history parser
//! ([`crate::parsers::codex`]) sort their reports through [`ContextReadings`]
//! alike, so the ring, the session details and the work-task compaction
//! threshold all read the same figure.
