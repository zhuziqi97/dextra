//! Version-gated compatibility patch for Cursor ACP sessions that omit
//! `enableAgentRetries` from `agentClient.run` options (see `agent-session.ts`).
//!
//! Cursor's ACP entry point builds its run options WITHOUT the flag, while the
//! TUI/headless path sets it from `retry-helpers.ts`'s `w5(action.case)`. The
//! run loop reads it as `null!==(g=_.enableAgentRetries)&&void 0!==g&&g` and
//! gates EVERY retry branch on `enableAgentRetries || endlessRetries`, so an
//! ACP session gets `undefined` -> `false` -> zero retries: the first transport
//! blip, stall or retryable server error ends the turn outright, where the TUI
//! would retry it (10 transport attempts / 3 server attempts). There is no
//! CLI flag, config key or env var that reaches the flag from outside, which
//! is why this is a bundle patch rather than a launch-argument change.
//!
//! This is NOT a regression in one release — `2026.08.11-e8db854` omits the
//! flag too — but the patch stays pinned to versions a maintainer has actually
//! triaged ([`TRIAGED_AFFECTED_VERSIONS`], kept honest by
//! `pinned_cursor_version_is_triaged`).
//!
//! # Why the splice is derived instead of transcribed
//!
//! Cursor regenerates its minified identifiers on every build, and — this is
//! the part that cost us — **per platform archive of the SAME version**. In
//! `2026.09.15-d2fe57e` the two statements before the run options are
//!
//! ```text
//! darwin: …,b=(0,S.K)({modelDetails:m,requestedModel:g}),y=new c.ConversationAction({action:{case:"userMessageAction",value:d}}),M=Object.assign(…
//! linux : …,y=(0,S.K)({modelDetails:m,requestedModel:g}),b=new c.ConversationAction({action:{case:"userMessageAction",value:d}}),k=Object.assign(…
//! ```
//!
//! — `y` and `b` are swapped. The bytes this patch anchors on are identical on
//! both, so a table keyed on the version alone matched the Linux bundle and
//! spliced in `y.action.case`, where `y` is the model-request struct with no
//! `action` at all: every single Cursor turn on Linux died with
//! `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'case')` before
//! the request ever left the process.
//!
//! `2026.09.18-9a7762b` rules out reading that as a two-way darwin/linux split:
//! its **windows/x64** archive takes the action local from one side and the
//! object-assign local from the other (`y=new …ConversationAction(…),k=Object
//! .assign(…`), where darwin is `y`/`M` and linux is `b`/`k`. The minifier
//! numbers each archive independently, so the only safe assumption is that
//! EVERY local is per-archive — which is what deriving them buys.
//!
//! So nothing about the splice is transcribed by hand any more:
//!
//!   * the anchor ([`RUN_OPTIONS_ANCHOR`]) is matched structurally, with the
//!     module-level identifiers it prints left as wildcards — one pattern now
//!     covers every generation, and the matched bytes are never rewritten,
//!     only inserted in front of;
//!   * the `ConversationAction` local the policy reads is looked up **in the
//!     very bundle being patched** ([`ACTION_LOCAL_DECL`]), so it cannot
//!     disagree with it;
//!   * and the injected expression is written so that reading the WRONG local
//!     still cannot throw ([`retry_policy_expression`]) — the worst case is
//!     upstream's policy not being consulted, never a dead session.
//!
//! [`repair_range`] additionally rewrites the earlier hand-transcribed splice
//! wherever it is already on disk: those installs answer "already fixed" to the
//! marker check, so without it a broken bundle would stay broken until the user
//! cleared the agent cache.
