//! Server-side re-hydration of uploaded image attachments.
//!
//! In web / remote-workspace mode the composer does NOT inline image bytes
//! into the `/acp_prompt` JSON body — a couple of screenshots of base64 would
//! blow past axum's default 2 MiB `DefaultBodyLimit` and the request would be
//! rejected with a plain-text 413 before the handler runs. Instead the client
//! uploads each image through `/upload_attachment` (streamed, size-capped,
//! with visible error toasts) and sends the prompt block with an **empty
//! payload** plus a `file://` uri pointing at the uploaded file. This module
//! reads those bytes back and fills the block in, so the agent still receives
//! a complete ACP image block (multimodal understanding is preserved — a bare
//! ResourceLink would leave it to the model to maybe-read the file as text).
//!
//! Two marker shapes exist, mirroring the two wire encodings the composer's
//! `imageAttachmentToPromptBlock` picks from the agent's prompt capabilities:
//!
//! - `Image { data: "", uri: Some("file://…") }` — agents that accept native
//!   image content.
//! - `Resource { blob: Some(""), mime_type: Some("image/*"), uri: "file://…" }`
//!   — agents that reject images but take embedded context (e.g. Grok). The
//!   client already chose the caps-correct shape, so hydration only fills
//!   bytes and never converts between shapes.
//!
//! Anything else — a block whose payload is already populated (the desktop
//! local path, which inlines over Tauri IPC where no body limit exists), a
//! non-`file://` uri (`clipboard://…` synth ids), a non-image resource — is
//! left untouched, so the desktop flow is byte-identical to before.
//!
//! Security: only files under `dextra_uploads_root()` are readable here. The
//! uri is percent-decoded, canonicalized, and prefix-checked against the
//! canonicalized root, so `acp_prompt` cannot be used as an arbitrary-file
//! read oracle (the viewer broadcast would otherwise ship the bytes to every
//! attached client). Hydration is read-only, so canonicalize + `starts_with`
//! is sufficient — the openat-based `upload_jail` machinery guards *writes*
//! against TOCTOU swaps and is not needed for a bounded read.
