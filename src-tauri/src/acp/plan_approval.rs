//! Grok plan-mode approval ("exit plan mode") domain types.
//!
//! When a Grok session is in **plan mode** and the agent finishes planning, it
//! calls its native `exit_plan_mode` tool. That tool reads `plan.md` from disk
//! and issues a BLOCKING ACP ext request (`_x.ai/exit_plan_mode`,
//! `ExitPlanModeExtRequest { sessionId, toolCallId, planContent }`) to the client
//! to get the user's approval before leaving plan mode. Grok waits for the reply.
//!
//! Dextra bridges that ext request into an interactive **plan-approval card**
//! rendered above the composer — the SAME shape as the `ask_user_question` bridge
//! ([`crate::acp::question`]) and the permission dialog: a pending request is
//! captured onto [`crate::acp::session_state::SessionState`] (in-memory, turn
//! scoped, carried on `to_snapshot()` so a mid-turn attach re-renders the card),
//! and the blocked ext request is answered once the user picks an action.
//!
//! Three outcomes exist (per Grok's binary + `~/.grok/docs/user-guide/19-plan-mode.md`):
//!   * **Approve** — leave plan mode and start implementing.
//!   * **Request changes** — freeform revision notes; the agent revises and plan
//!     mode stays active (the user can iterate).
//!   * **Abandon** — abandon the plan and turn plan mode off.
//!
//! ## Wire-format (confirmed against Grok 0.2.111, live ACP capture)
//!
//! Request `ExitPlanModeExtRequest = { sessionId, toolCallId, planContent }`.
//! Note `planContent` is often `null` — Grok does NOT embed the plan body in the
//! request; after approval it reads `plan.md` itself, so the card's plan preview
//! can be empty here.
//!
//! Reply `ExitPlanModeExtResponse = { "outcome": <string>, "feedback": <string> }`
//! (the field is `outcome`, NOT `decision`). Only two outcome values are
//! recognized; every other value (and a missing field) falls through Grok's
//! `#[serde(other)]` catch-all to keep-planning, and the reply `feedback` is then
//! discarded:
//!   * `"approved"`  — leave plan mode and start implementing. A non-empty
//!     `feedback` becomes "approve with review comments".
//!   * `"abandoned"` — abandon the plan and turn plan mode off.
//!   * anything else (we send `"keep_planning"`) — stay in plan mode. Grok drops
//!     the reply `feedback`, so the user's revision notes must be delivered
//!     out-of-band as a follow-up prompt (mirroring Grok's own TUI, where
//!     "request changes" moves focus to the prompt).
//!
//! An earlier inferred shape (`{ decision: "approve"/... }`) was wrong: Grok
//! silently defaulted it to keep-planning, so "Approve" read as "request changes".
