//! WHICH SIDE of the ACP connection actually touches the disk and spawns
//! commands — a peer of
//! [`FsAccessPolicy`](crate::acp::file_system_runtime::FsAccessPolicy), not a
//! part of it (it governs the `terminal/*` channel too).
//!
//! dextra advertises `fs.readTextFile` / `fs.writeTextFile` / `terminal` on
//! Initialize, and an agent that sees them stops using its own in-process
//! backends and delegates: grok, for instance, switches from its local file
//! reader to `fs/read_text_file` and from its local shell to `terminal/create`.
//! dextra then services both **in dextra's own process**
//! ([`crate::acp::file_system_runtime::FileSystemRuntime`],
//! [`crate::acp::terminal_runtime::TerminalRuntime`]).
//!
//! That is the whole of issue #436: an OS-level sandbox the agent applies to
//! ITSELF (grok's seatbelt/landlock profiles, `~/.grok/sandbox.toml`) covers the
//! agent's process tree. dextra's process is not in it, so a kernel deny on
//! `**/.env` is structurally unable to see the read — the audit log records the
//! profile as applied and enforced, and no violation, because from the kernel's
//! point of view the agent never touched the file.
//!
//! dextra cannot fix that by *containing* the agent. Refusing the capabilities
//! instead restores the agent's ability to contain ITSELF: the operations move
//! back inside its process, where its own sandbox and permission rules already
//! work. Measured against grok 1.0.0 with `deny = ["**/.env_test"]`: with the
//! capabilities advertised the secret is read and nothing is logged; with them
//! withheld the read fails `EPERM`, the agent's `cat`/`grep` fallbacks fail too
//! (they are children of ITS process), and `FsViolation` lands in the audit log.
//!
//! Opt-in, because it is not free — see [`HostToolsPolicy::Agent`].
