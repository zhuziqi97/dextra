//! Broker-facing request / outcome types.
//!
//! These cross two boundaries:
//! 1. The MCP companion serializes `DelegationRequest` → JSON-RPC params and
//!    deserializes `DelegationOutcome` → MCP `tool_result`.
//! 2. The broker emits a structured outcome the listener can persist and
//!    forward to the parent's tool_use_id.
//!
//! DB ids are `i32` to match the actual `conversation.id` / `conversation.parent_id`
//! column types — keeping them strongly typed here saves us a parse-or-die step
//! at every DB boundary.
