//! Wire format for `codeg-mcp` companion ↔ main process round-trip over UDS
//! (Unix) or named pipe (Windows).
//!
//! The frame is dead simple: a little-endian `u32` byte length followed by
//! that many bytes of UTF-8 JSON. One request, one response — the companion
//! reopens the socket per `tools/call`. This trades a few extra connects for
//! a wire that's trivial to test and that doesn't need multiplexing
//! (a parent makes at most one delegation call at a time from the LLM's
//! perspective — the broker handles concurrency at a higher level).
//!
//! Why length-prefix instead of newline-delimited JSON? The LLM-issued
//! `task` arguments can contain newlines, and we'd rather avoid escaping
//! them into a single line. JSON-RPC over stdio uses newlines because
//! Content-Length headers add complexity; for an internal UDS we can do
//! better.
//!
//! ### Message shapes
//!
//! Inbound traffic is a tagged [`BrokerMessage`] enum, one variant per MCP
//! tool plus the MCP cancel notification:
//!   * `call` — [`BrokerRequest`] for `delegate_to_agent`; returns a
//!     [`BrokerResponse`] wrapping a `DelegationTaskReport` (a `Running` ack, or
//!     a terminal report).
//!   * `status` — [`BrokerStatusRequest`] for `get_delegation_status`. Carries a
//!     `task_ids` list (one or many) and an optional `wait_ms` long-poll —
//!     omitted is an immediate snapshot, an explicit `0` blocks until a task is
//!     terminal, a positive value is a bounded wait. Returns a `{ "tasks": [..] }`
//!     envelope with one task report per requested id (in request order); a
//!     batch wait wakes as soon as ANY requested task reaches a terminal state.
//!   * `cancel_task` — [`BrokerCancelTaskRequest`] for `cancel_delegation`;
//!     returns a task report.
//!   * `cancel` — fire-and-forget [`BrokerCancelRequest`] from MCP
//!     `notifications/cancelled`, targeting an in-flight `delegate_to_agent`
//!     call by `external_handle`; gets a `Value::Null` ack.
//!
//! All arms are authenticated by the same per-launch `token`.
//!
//! ### Version coupling
//!
//! The companion (`codeg-mcp`) and the listener (inside the codeg main
//! process) ship in the SAME release artifact — the Tauri bundle, the
//! server Docker image, and the standalone binary tree all install both
//! binaries at the same path. The MCP config pointing the agent CLI at
//! `codeg-mcp` uses an absolute path that is replaced atomically by the
//! upgrade, so an old-version companion talking to a new-version listener
//! is not a supported configuration. As a consequence this protocol does
//! NOT carry a version field and the tagged-enum cutover from the older
//! plain-`BrokerRequest` frame is deliberately non-backward-compatible —
//! a stale companion would fail to decode and surface as a JSON-RPC
//! error to the LLM, which is preferable to silent misbehavior.
