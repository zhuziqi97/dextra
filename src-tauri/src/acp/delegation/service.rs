//! Lifecycle handle for the dextra-mcp broker socket — the half of the
//! companion round-trip that lives inside dextra's own process.
//!
//! Both runtimes bind the socket once at boot and then forget about it: the
//! accept loop is a detached task, so a bind failure (address taken, `/tmp`
//! not writable) is logged and lost, and a socket the OS later takes away
//! (a `/tmp` reaper on a long-lived desktop session; an admin deleting the
//! file) leaves every subsequently-launched companion talking to nothing,
//! with no way back short of restarting the app.
//!
//! [`DelegationService`] closes both gaps. It owns the bound socket's task
//! handle plus the last bind error, exposes a real end-to-end liveness probe
//! ([`BrokerMessage::Ping`](super::transport::BrokerMessage::Ping)), and can
//! rebind on demand — which is what the workspace status indicator's
//! "start service" button drives.
//!
//! The handle is a process singleton (the socket path is PID-scoped, and each
//! runtime binds exactly one), so bootstrap [`install`]s it and any command
//! handler reaches it through [`current`] rather than threading it through
//! `AppState` and every test constructor.

    ///    `/tmp` reaper can unlink out from under a running loop — its name
    ///    cannot disappear while the loop holds an instance. A live loop
    ///    therefore always implies a reachable pipe, and a probe that says
    ///    otherwise is a false negative (all instances momentarily busy, or a
    ///    stalled runtime), not a fault to repair. Rebinding on that signal
    ///    would abort a working acceptor and then very likely fail to replace
    ///    it: `first_pipe_instance` is refused while ANY instance exists, and
    ///    the connection workers this loop spawned are deliberately left
    ///    running — a parked `ask_user_question` holds its instance until a
    ///    human answers, an unbounded `get_delegation_status` until a child's
    ///    turn ends. The result would be no acceptor at all, for as long as
    ///    that connection lives. So on Windows a live loop is reported as
    ///    already-running and left alone.
    ///
    ///    What remains is narrow and fails safely: if the loop has genuinely
    ///    died while such a worker is still parked, the rebind returns
    ///    `PermissionDenied` and the caller sees it. Nothing was destroyed to
    ///    get there — the acceptor was already gone.
    ///
    /// 2. **Bind before retiring the old loop.** A failed bind then leaves the
    ///    existing acceptor untouched instead of having already killed it. On
    ///    unix the new socket takes over the path via an atomic rename (see
    ///    [`DelegationListener::bind`], which never unlinks the destination),
    ///    so the path is continuously served and the old loop is simply left
    ///    holding the inode that path no longer names; it is retired
    ///    immediately below. (On Windows rule 1 means we only ever get here
    ///    with no live loop to protect.)
    ///
    /// 3. **Nothing awaits between a successful bind and the commit.** This
    ///    function runs inside an axum handler / Tauri command whose future is
    ///    dropped if the caller goes away — a user who clicks "start" and then
    ///    closes the window. An await in that stretch would let the cancellation
    ///    land with the replacement socket bound but never installed: it would
    ///    be dropped, leaving a dead socket file owning the path while the old
    ///    loop sat on the inode that path no longer names. Silently unreachable,
    ///    and `state` would still claim the old acceptor was fine. Keeping the
    ///    stretch await-free makes bind-then-commit atomic against cancellation.
