//! Self-cleanup watchdog for `dextra-mcp`.
//!
//! On Windows, child processes don't die with their parent automatically.
//! On Unix the kernel closes the inherited pipe ends so `stdin` reads EOF
//! and the loop exits — usually. In both worlds a misbehaving intermediate
//! (agent CLI that hangs, parent dextra crash that orphans the agent) can
//! leave `dextra-mcp` running forever, holding open the binary file and a
//! companion connection that no one will ever read from.
//!
//! When the parent dextra / dextra-server passes `--parent-pid <pid>` on
//! the command line, `dextra-mcp` spawns this watchdog. It polls the OS
//! every couple of seconds and, the moment the parent PID stops existing,
//! tears down the process. Polling (vs. a kernel notification) keeps the
//! implementation tiny and identical across platforms; the 2 s tick is
//! invisible next to the other work `dextra-mcp` does.
//!
//! The check is intentionally not exposed as a long-lived handle — there
//! is no graceful "stop watching" path because the only outcome is
//! `process::exit`.
//!
//! Backward compatibility: the `--parent-pid` flag is optional. Older
//! parents that don't pass it get today's behavior (no watchdog).
