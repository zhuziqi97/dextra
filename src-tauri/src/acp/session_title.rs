//! Live ACP session titles.
//!
//! Agents publish a session name through `session_info_update.title`. Codeg
//! used to ignore that field and only adopt a title the next time the
//! conversation was loaded from disk. These helpers extract a usable title
//! from the live notification so the lifecycle worker can write it immediately.
//!
//! Not every agent can push, and Claude Code could not until recently: through
//! claude-agent-acp 0.72.0 its adapter had no wire event for the generated
//! title — it read the name back out of the session file at turn-end — so
//! `acp::background_watch` reads the same `ai-title` / `custom-title` records
//! off the transcript it is already tailing and hands them to
//! [`publish_native_title`], which is the one place that decides whether a
//! title reaches the lifecycle worker.
//!
//! 0.73.0 adds the wire event (`session-titles.js`: Claude Code's own
//! auto-titling never arms under the Agent SDK, so the adapter now asks the CLI
//! via `generate_session_title` and publishes the result as
//! `session_info_update.title`). That makes the two producers below REAL for
//! Claude rather than theoretical, which is what the single critical section in
//! [`publish_native_title`] was already built for. The transcript path stays:
//! it also carries `custom-title` and pre-0.73 installs, and the adapter
//! persists its generated title into the same session file, so both producers
//! converge on one string and the skip-cache absorbs the duplicate.

/// session's `session_info_update`s serially) and — for Claude — the transcript
/// watcher's own task, which reads the same name off `ai-title` /
/// `custom-title` records on its own poll cadence. Splitting the test from the
/// set would let both admit the same string and write it twice; the single
/// critical section makes "only a CHANGED title gets through" hold by
/// construction rather than by the two callers happening not to overlap.
///
/// What the critical section does NOT order is the `emit` that follows it: two
/// producers admitting DIFFERENT strings can broadcast in the opposite order,
/// leaving the older name written last. Note what does NOT repair that: the
/// transcript re-emitting the same `ai-title` record, because the watcher has
/// already folded that value into its own slots and will not re-queue it. What
/// does is a later detail fetch (it re-resolves the whole file) or the next
/// genuinely different title from either producer — including the adapter's own
/// turn-end pull, whose `lastTitle` now differs from what the file holds. So the
/// window is recoverable auto-title staleness, not a stuck name, and not worth
/// serializing the whole publish behind the state lock.
///
/// The third writer of `last_native_title` is the `ConversationLinked` arm,
/// which is emitted ONLY while the row is still unbound and therefore can never
/// race a title this admits.
///
/// A title published before the first prompt binds the row has nowhere to land
/// and is dropped WITHOUT being remembered, so the same string is still
/// accepted once the row exists.

/// `refresh_auto_title` write is itself a no-op on a user-renamed
/// (`title_locked`) row and on an unchanged value — so repeats that do get
/// past the skip-cache still cost nothing and can never overwrite a name the
