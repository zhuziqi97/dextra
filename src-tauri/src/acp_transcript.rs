//! dextra's own **ACP-native transcript** for custom agents.
//!
//! Every built-in agent ships a dedicated parser (`crate::parsers::*`) that
//! reverse-engineers that agent's private session store to rebuild history.
//! A custom ACP agent has no such parser — and writing one per agent is
//! exactly what "add an agent by pasting registry info" is meant to avoid.
//!
//! The observation that makes this unnecessary is the same one
//! [`crate::turn_timings`] already relies on: **every session runs through
//! dextra**, so the connection layer witnesses the entire conversation. Here we
//! take it all the way — instead of recording a derived measurement, we record
//! the ACP wire itself:
//!
//! * each prompt dextra sends (`session/prompt`'s content blocks), and
//! * each `session/update` notification the agent sends back, verbatim.
//!
//! [`crate::parsers::acp_native`] reads that back and projects it into
//! `MessageTurn`s using nothing but ACP semantics — no agent-specific
//! knowledge anywhere in the loop.
//!
//! ## Why raw ACP and not dextra's own `AcpEvent`
//!
//! `AcpEvent` is an internal type that changes with every UI feature; persisting
//! it would silently corrupt old history on refactors. The ACP `SessionUpdate`
//! wire format is an external, versioned specification, so a transcript written
//! today still parses after arbitrary internal churn.
//!
//! ## File layout
//!
//! `<paths::dextra_acp_transcripts_root()>/<registry-id>/<session-id>.jsonl`
//!
//! Line 0 is a [`TranscriptHeader`]; every later line is a [`TranscriptEntry`]:
//!
//! ```jsonc
//! {"v":1,"kind":"header","agent":"custom:goose","session_id":"…","cwd":"/repo","started_at_ms":…}
//! {"t":1750000000000,"k":"prompt","p":[{"type":"text","text":"hi"}]}
//! {"t":1750000000123,"k":"update","p":{"sessionUpdate":"agent_message_chunk", …}}
//! ```
//!
//! Unknown/malformed lines are skipped by the reader, and a missing file simply
//! means "no history" — recording is best-effort by contract and must never
//! block or fail a turn.
//!
//! ## Write-behind
//!
//! Agents stream a reply as a long run of tiny chunks — measured at 32 records
//! for a turn the same agent replays as one merged chunk — and the reader joins
//! them straight back together. Writing each fragment would store an order of
//! magnitude more bytes than the conversation contains and make every later
//! read pay for it, so streamed text is buffered for at most
//! [`FLUSH_WINDOW`] and written merged (see [`compact_batch`], which also
//! argues why the reader cannot tell the difference).
//!
//! Everything else is written the moment it arrives: prompts, turn ends and
//! headers never wait, and neither does anything recorded outside a live turn
//! (a `session/load` replay is stored verbatim — it is already merged, and
//! merging it would need turn boundaries it does not have).
//!
//! Writes are pure appends: no record is ever rewritten or truncated once it
//! has landed. A crash therefore costs at most the last unflushed window of an
//! in-progress reply, and never a completed turn. A write *failure* costs
//! nothing on its own — the batch stays buffered and is retried, and its
//! `record_entry` receiver reports whether it eventually landed — except in the
//! one case where a partial write cannot be rolled back, where the batch is
//! abandoned rather than risk duplicating history that did land.

/// An agent streams a reply as tens or hundreds of one-word chunks;

/// more bytes than the conversation contains (measured at 32:1 against the same
/// turn replayed by `session/load`), and every later read pays for it.

/// Merging is invisible to the projection because:
///
/// * **Content.** `push_text` appends consecutive same-kind chunks into one
///   `ContentBlock`, so N chunks and their concatenation build the same block.
/// * **End of the turn.** `apply_update` sets `last_at_ms` from every chunk, so
///   taking the run's LAST timestamp reproduces it exactly — without relying on
///   a `TurnEnd` to overwrite it, which a turn flushed early by a mid-turn user
///   chunk never gets.
/// * **Start of the turn.** That comes from the prompt's timestamp, and prompts
///   are never merged. The one case where a turn starts from a chunk instead is
///   a transcript with no prompts at all — a replay — which `compactable`
///   excludes.
/// * **Everything else** (tool calls, plans, user chunks, images, resource
///   links) is written through unchanged.
