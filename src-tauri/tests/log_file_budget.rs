//! End-to-end guard on the daily byte ceiling for the on-disk log.
//!
//! `logging::budget`'s unit tests cover the accounting; this covers the *wiring*,
//! which is where the bug actually lived: `Rotation::DAILY` + `max_log_files`
//! bounds days, not bytes, so nothing stopped one day's file from reaching the
//! 34.36 GB a 0.23.3 field report measured (issue #427). A refactor that unhooks
//! `BudgetedWriter` from `init_file_writer`, or an appender swap that bypasses
//! it, would leave every unit test green — so assert on the real file: build the
//! real subscriber, emit far more than the ceiling, and read the size back off
//! disk.
//!
//! It also covers the **same-day restart**, which is the subtler half of the
//! same bug: the appender re-opens an existing dated file with `append(true)`
//! (`tracing-appender-0.2.5/src/rolling.rs:791`), so a budget that started
//! counting at zero handed out a whole new ceiling on every launch — and this
//! app restarts itself (the `--supervise` worker, auto update), so a crash loop
//! could still grow one file without bound. The test seeds today's file first and
//! asserts the *total* stays under the ceiling. That doubles as a check on
//! `budget::resume_point`'s filename reconstruction: if it guessed the name
//! wrong it would measure 0, and the file would end up at seed + ceiling.
//!
//! One `#[test]` per file on purpose: installing a subscriber is a process-global
//! one-shot, and the env vars this sets (`DEXTRA_HOME`, `DEXTRA_LOG_MAX_BYTES`) are
//! read during that install.
